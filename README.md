# Introduction to the Level 9 archive
Mike Austin, Feb 2025.
The Level 9 archive is based on around 1000 floppy disks from various system, of which about 500 were read between 2021 and 2024, mainly using an Atari ST emulatir running on a PC.
This GitHub repo is a work in progress. Here are some of the folders which i have processed so far.

## "floppy disk archive" 
contains the files from the floppy disks retrieved from the Level 9 archive. some if the dusks could not be read due to degradation of the media. However, in many cases there are several copies of affected folders/systems, so I have tried to pull together all the necessary files from multiple disks 
## "game sources" 
contains source codes for specific games 
## "sys sources" 
contains source code for both the game authoring system (squasher, acode compiler, etc.) and the runtime systems.
## "sys sources/docs" 
contains a manual for the overall system, but unfortunately it's in 1st word format, and needs converting to a more modern word processor format and/or pdf
# Next steps
1. There are many floppy disks still to be read
2. More source disk folders need to be sorted to get consistent sets of system and game source codes
3. underlying system software like acode compiler, squasher and interpreters need to be compiled and got working on more modern systems.
