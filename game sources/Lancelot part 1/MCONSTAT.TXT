; Machine-specific constants for Amstrad cpc Tape.

CONST
 maxactivations=10 ; tailor to each machine. The greater the
; number, the more that can happen on each turn. Small machines
; should have this set to as small a value as possible, without
; losing realism. About 3 might be realistic.
; 16 bit machines can handle much higher values - perhaps 10-16
; without losing too much speed.

; kbddelay=30 for 16 bit machines
; 10 for 8 bit machines
 kbddelay=30 ; time to wait when attention flag is set

; Versioning notes.....
