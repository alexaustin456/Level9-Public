[2490:said "thankyou for coming, Lancelot"]
[2491:said "you fought well at the ford yesterday"]
[2492:said "you showed great charity by sparing me"]
;;[2492:told Lancelot to kneel, then pulled out his sword and
;;knighted Lancelot "arise, Sir Lancelot"]
;;[2493:told Lancelot to leave. Guenever fluttered her eyelashes at
;;Lancelot in an inviting, but coy, fashion]


[2493:knighted Lancelot, and insisted that
he stay and dine with them. As they sat
through the meal, and the drinks flowed, Lancelot kept stealing
glances across at Queen Guenever. Truly, he thought, she was a
beautiful and stately woman. And as the meal wore on, he realized he
was falling in love with her.% Once or twice he caught Guenever
casting him sidelong looks in return, almost coyly, and eventually,
feeling like a small boy, he plucked up the courage to ask to be her
champion. As he had feared, she refused to consider being championed
by a novice, and for a dreadful moment Lancelot thought she would
rebuff him entirely.%
But then Guenever smiled knowingly at him and invited him to return to
her when he had proved himself to be worthy of her patronage. At this,
Lancelot felt a huge swell of pride and promised he would not fail
her, but would go to Logris without delay, there to honour Guenever
with noble deeds and battles chivalrously won.%
Then Arthur looked up from his plate and looked at Lancelot. "I tell
you one thing you could do. There are some knights of mine - all
honourable fellows of the Round Table here - who are being held
captive by these rebel lords who seem to think they own the place.
Now, if you could bring some of them back to Camelot as free men, that
would make you pretty worthy of anyone, for a start". ]

[2499:at this point, you have the option of going straight to the 
last part, the Quest for the Holy Grail, but I assume you want to 
play the whole game. Shall we start at the beginning? ]

[2500:they fought for a long time, first one gaining the
advantage, then the other. Finally, completely exhausted, the
black knight yielded. Did Lancelot accept his surrender? ]
[2501:Lancelot brutally attacked the defenceless knight, knocking
him to the ground and unfastening his his helmet, ready for the
fatal blow.%
 %But, before Lancelot could strike, dozens of guards appeared from
the bushes and hurled him to the ground.%
 %The black knight identified himself as King Arthur, and severely
chastised Lancelot for his lack of honour or chivalry. The king's
party then rode off towards Camelot]
;
[2502:the black knight revealed himself as King Arthur. "Thank you,
Lancelot, you fought most honourably", he said with a bow, "I would
be happy to knight you if thou wouldst come tomorrow, to my castle
in Camelot."%
 %The king summoned his guards from the surrounding bushes, where
they had hidden to watch the fight, and the royal party rode off
towards the city]

[2504:"I will not parley until we have fought"]
[2505:said, "Well, have you not the stomach for a fight"]
[2506:said, "If you will not strike the first blow, I will". With that,
he prepared to strike]

adjusted to the sunlight, he realized it was coming from the roof of

hawks]

remove your armour and fight with one hand tie behind your back".
Lancelot agreed, and the fight began. Despite being handicapped,
Lancelot still defeated Meliagaunt, who surrendered. Guenever was
freed]
[2678:thanked Lancelot for saving her]

that Meliagaunt should be captured and brought back to Camelot. Then
he said, "Thank you for defending my Queen's honour"]
 [2680:now all the Knights of the Round Table were assembled, life
proceeded normally at court. Lancelot lived happily, doing great deeds,
and enjoying occasional secret liaisons with Guenever. About twenty
years passed in this way, until a prophesy appeared above the Siege
Perilous about the imminent arrival of Galahad (*quotation*) who
would lead the grail quest.% %Lancelot removed his armour
and sword, and decided to the see the Queen
to take his leave of her before setting out on the grail quest]
