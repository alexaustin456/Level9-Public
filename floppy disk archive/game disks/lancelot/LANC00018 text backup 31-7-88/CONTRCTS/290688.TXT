Dear Dicon, 

           I enclose a cheque for five hundred pounds as the first 
half of the payment for your invoice of 22 June. The remainder will 
follow on acceptance of the revised CBM 64 pictures for "Lancelot". 

I hope that your new monitor makes life easier! 

           Now, on to another matter. As you may have gathered from 
our recent 'phone conversan the possibility of paying a bonus 
if the pictures are exceptionally good, but we can only afford 2000 
pounds per game. 

Sorry about the confusion, which was a mistake on my part. 


                      Best wishes, 


                                  Pete Austin
