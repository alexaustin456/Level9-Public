Dear Christina,

               Time & Magik is now launched, the final gaps are 
filled in the Lancelot design (see enclosed copies), and the 
first version of the Lancelot program should be ready in about a 
fortnight (parts 2 and 3 are already complete, apart from bugs). 

Pictures are being drawn even as I write so, once the text is moving 
again, I'll be no longer blops it could be drastically 
shortened. 

3) The Tristram story is definitely not needed. 

4) The Sangrail story should be completed, with Galahad arriving 
at court, a few incidents from the search for the Grail and how 
Lancelot and the others saw it. We don't need the "post-Grail" 
adventures of the Grail knights, but it would be nice to learn how 
Lancelot returned to court.  

5) Lancelot should be referred to, where appropriate, in all the 
various stories. Otherwise, people will have diffps it could be drastically 
shortened.

book to the game. 
 
6) It would be nice if the language used had more of the flavour of 
the time. 

               That seems to be everything; please 'phone if you have 
any questions. It would be nice if we had a final version in the next 
couple of weeks, before the time comes to add the final text to the 
game. I hope this is possible. 


                            Best wishes, 



                                        Pete Austin
