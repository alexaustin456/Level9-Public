Dear Chris, 

           BBC "Time and Magik" was working on the Master yesterday, 
so I expect to bring a demo disk to the exhibition tomorrow. It 
looks pretty good, and seemed to have everything working (pictures, 
line editor, ram save and undo, save/restore etc). 

The final release version will still take a little time, however, as 
we still have to package the "small machine" version of the system 
(it's working, I think, but not finalised) and, of course, check the 
game on a great variety of hardware. 

           We all looked at the Grail sketch yesterday, and called 
upon the opinion of a couple of unbiased visitors. Briefly... 

We obtained rare unanimity in the opinion that, briefly, the 
ornamentation was good, but the overall shape of the chalice looked 
wrong. It's too spindly. 

If its height was squashed to less than half the current proportion, 
and (additionally) the bowl increased significantly in size relative 
to the stem, then you'd have more the right effect. 

I would personally go for slightly less complex ornamentation, with 
perhaps a "frosted" ring around the body of the bowl to emphasise 
its apparent weight. 

                         Best wishes, 


                                     Pete Austin.


PS: My thanks to those involved on the "triple-format" press release, 
which was re-written well and seems to have reached the mags already.
