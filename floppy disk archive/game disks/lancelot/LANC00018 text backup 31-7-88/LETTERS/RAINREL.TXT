Dear Clare, 

         Here's a suggested press release to announce the Rainbird/L9 
break. I've been waiting for Paul's written version of the termination 
agreement, but in the continuing absence of this I thought I'd better 
reply to your fax of the 5th. I'll be happy to agree to a statement as 
soon as Paul's letter gets here.

********************************************************************** 

Rainbird Software at under the Rainbird label, will now be published by Mandarin. 

"We would like to thank Rainbird for doing a good job of marketing 
Jewels of Darkness, Silicon Dreams and Knight Orc. However, we now 
feel that the time is right for us to move on", says Pete Austin of 
Level 9.

PS (not part of suggested release):

The reason for the phrasing: "Rainbird Software and Level 9 are to 
part company, after the latter's decision to join a new publishing 
venture." is that this is what in fact happened. 

Although we have been bound by confidentiality not to mention the 
matter until now, Level 9 and Europress signed a deal to cover future 
product last Autumn, some time before we had any clue that Paul 
intended to terminate the Rainbird-Level 9 contract for Time & Magik.
