Dear Nusarath, 

              Thank you for sending the discs to demonstrate your 
graphical style, and with pictures for Lancelot. I enclose four 
discs in exchange, so that you will lose on the deal. Two of them 
contain copies of our previous Lancelot pictures. 

I like your work, and expect to contact you soon to see if you can 
do some pictures on our next game - please allow me about two weeks 
to get things organised. 

              As we discussed over the 'phone, there is a problem 
with the Lancelot pictures, which seems to have been the fault of 
someone at Database who sent you a bodged original without telling 
either us or you. 

It is important that the border uses only colours 0, 14 & 15, and 
that these have values  0,0,0  3,3,3  and 5,5,5 respectively. 

Currently the borders seem to use colours 1, 2 and 14 (with values 
1,1,1  3,3,3  and 5,5,5) which means they'll have to be altered 
before we can use them in the game. Also, the border may look 
somewhat less sharp than we intended on the box screenshots (because 
of using dark grey in place of black as the darkest colour). 

Someone (probably you, I guess) will have to swap the colours around 
and corect matters. 

              The only other changes I mentioned were to tone down 
the colour of Guenevere's collar and that of of the trappings of the 
Black Knight's horse. 

I like all the pictures, though. Especially the Hermit and Vikings. 

                     Regards, 


                             Pete Austin
