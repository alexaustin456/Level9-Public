Dear Chris, 

           Following your giving me Nusarath Jahan's phone number, 
we have got in touch and he has sent me an unofficial copy of his 
ST pictures for Lancelot. 

I like all the pictures, especially the Hermit and Vikings, and the 
only requests that I've passed on to Nusarath are that he tone down 
the colour of Guenevere's collar and that of of the trappings of the 
Black Knight's horse. 

           Unfortunately however, there is a problem which seems 
to have resulted from him being supplied with a bodged original 
picture, without him or us being told that it had been altered.  

Picture borders should use only colours 0, 14 & 15, (with values 
0,0,0  3,3,3 and 5,5,5 respectively). 

Unfortunately, the original picture supplied to Nusarath seems to 
have been altered, so that its border used colours 1, 2 and 14, 
(with values 1,1,1  3,3,3 and 5,5,5). He has faithfully copied this.  

The resulting new pictures will have to be corrected before we can 
use them in the game - and the borders will meanwhile look less 
good than intended on screenshots (because of using dark grey in 
place of black as the darkest colour). 


                        Regards,
