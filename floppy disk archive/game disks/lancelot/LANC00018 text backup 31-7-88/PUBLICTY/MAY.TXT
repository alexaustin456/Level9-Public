                      LEVEL 9 NEWS: MAY 1988

* Level 9 are proud to announce what we believe is a world record: 
  triple-format discs. Spectrum +3 versions of Gnome Ranger and 
  Time & Magik also run on Amstrad CPCs and PCWs - all with pics. 

  Also, +3 Time and Magik contains all you need to adapt the Amstrad 
  CPC/PCW disks of our Rainbird games for the +3. Don't wait while 
  Rainbird decide whether to launch our games on the +3... Buy the  
  Amstrad CPC/PCW versions and upgrade them yourself! 

* All but one version of Time and Magik are on sale: the exception 
  being the 80-track BBC disk for expanded BBC B (with sideways RAM 
  or common types of shadow RAM), BBC Master, or BBC B+. 

* ST Time and Magik has a new interpreter which allows you to choose 
  big text: this can be copied for use with Knight Orc and Gnome R. 

* The next Level 9/Mandarin game is "Lancelot", a faithful re-telling 
  of the Arthurian quest for the Holy Grail. Expect it early Summer. 
  And finally, Level 9 t-shirts (S,M,L,XL) are just 4 pounds each.
