At first, read Merlin's books. Take the first word of each book 
extract and sort them into the "master riddle", taking both the 
meaning and the initial letters:
"The Isthmus Narrows To A Grassy Exposed Land" (Tintagel). 

"Arthur Lies Deep Entombed; Rocky Lumps Embellish Yonder Eminence's 
Damp Gritstone Escarpment" (Alderley Edge). 

"Defended Inhabitation Near Anglesey; Storms Enshroud Merlin's 
Rich Yellow Secret" (Dinas Emrys). 


At last, do much the same:
"merlin'S gianT micrO upoN thE heatH; thE well-knowN standinG circlE"
(Stonehenge). 

"inspirinG knolL. arimitheA joseph'S lefT long-agO hawthorN shruB. 
yoU touR abbeY" (Glastonbury). 

"steeP mooR, wherE arthur'S megalithiC gravE knolL wilL qualifY" 
(Prescelly).

"famouS mountaiN O' arroW roaD tO cairN" (Snowdon).

"taboO hilL belongeD tO arthur'S father-in-laW, whilE knightS foughT 
foR chivalrY" (Old Oswestry). 


And, in the middle:
"unDer floOded haZes, faMed grAil secRets maYbe esPy'd. yOu wOn 
chaLice" (Dozmary Pool).
