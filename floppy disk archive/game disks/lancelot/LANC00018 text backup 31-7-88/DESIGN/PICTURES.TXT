                       PICTURE DETAILS
                       ---------------

The idea was to get significantly better quality pictures than 
previous games; e.g with extensive use of pattern fill. Whenever 
possible, the pictures were from Lancelot's viewpoint. 

Roads (1-5):
 1.  Border (16-bit only) plus road through open woodland. 
 2.  Path through forest. 
 3.  Narrow Ledge ascending the cliff to Nacien's hermitage. A path 
sloped diagonally upwards to the right, across a sheer limestone 
cliff, towards a stone building near the top. 
 4.  Narrow mediaeval street through Camelot city. This scene was like 
the shambles in York: a narrow alleyway between overhanging houses. 
 5.  Ford, guarded by Black Knight. A cobbled track led between over- 
hanging willows and through a wide place in the stream; in front of 
which sat a knight in black plate mail; apon a black horse with white 
markings on nose and feet. 

Rooms (6-12):
 6.  Stone-walled corridor. With exposed oak beams above. 
 7.  Stone-walled room. Ditto. 
 8.  Mews, with hawk roosting overhead. 
 9.  Merlin's study. A room of great untidiness, wallpapered with 
books and with magical miscellanea all around. 
10.  Guenever's bedroom. Draped with rich fabric; with a four-poster 
bed, dressing table with mirror; window like a pointed arch with a 
cross to separate the four panes; rugs on the floor. 
11.  Arthur's Hall, with Round Table. The table was like the rim of 
a wheel in shape (not e.g a plate) and was surrounded by massive, 
high-backed chairs, like those in the chancels of some churches. 
12.  Turquin's round prison from above; with iron "lift" cage above. 
The film version of "Man of la Mancha" had such a great prison-pit; 
with a walkway round the edge of a cylindrical pit. 

Castles (13-19): 
The castles were something like those in "Defender of the Crown"; oodland clearing) 
19.  Chapel, at the end of a woodland road. The road led to its side 
door, through a small graveyard. The small spire was on the right.  

Misc (20-26): 
20.  Garden, below Guenever's window. 
21.  Stone Cross, in the wasteland. 
22.  Spring and pool, in a decorative glade. 
23.  Sessoine invasion fleet, drawn up on beach; bonfire on the sand.
24.  Magic boat, draped in white Samite, on the beach. 
25.  View of sea, from the magic boat. The prow of the boat was 
visible in theoodland clearing) 
19.  Chapel, at the end of a woodland road. The road led to its side 
door, through a small graveyard. The small spire was on the right.  

Misc (20-26): 
20.  Garden, below Guenever's window.

visible in the foreground; with waves and gulls beyond.

steam to protect her modesty. She was holding out her right hand 
towards the viewer. 

Grail (27-30): 
27.  Light of Holy Grail, shining through door.
28.  Holy Grail, appearing to the host of the Round Table. The grail 
is a richly decorated cup; something like a fat chess-queen, turned 
upside down. It had no handles, and glowed brightly as it floated 
above the Round Table. 
29.  Holy Grail, appearing to Lancelot at the end of the game. 
30.  Loading Screen (following design of box cover).
