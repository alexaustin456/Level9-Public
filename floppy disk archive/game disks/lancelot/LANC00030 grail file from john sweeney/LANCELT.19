                         LANCELOT CONTEST 

Within the Lancelot game was a prize contest to find a solid 
silver grail, encrusted with jewels. It was found on 28/2/89, 
and this sheet contains full details of the contest so that 
you can test your wits against the winner. 


                           FIRST STAGE 

Treasure contests are risky things to design. Some are too 
easy and solved almost instantly (Cadbury's quest for golden 
Easter eggs resulted in some being dug up even before the 
questions were published). And others are too difficult. (One 
pirate quest for a golden key and #50,000 prize has never been 
solved. The organisers say they are snowed under by letters from 
frustrated seekers, and would love to bring it to an end, but 
they can't legally change its terms). 

So I wanted a two stage quest, with four preliminary rounds, one 
per month, each with nine winners to go on to the final. That 
way I would know how long the first stage would take, and could 
adjust the difficulty of the preliminary rounds if we were 
getting too many, or too few, winners. 

The preliminary contests all worked the same way. You 'phoned 
a special Grail Hotline to learn the current starting clue. For 
example, "Welcome to the Grail Hotline. The clue for October is 
a weighty matter". This meant the relevant clue words (all in 
capitals) were those in the same sentence as something to do 
with weight, e.g pound, ounce, ton. You sorted them into a 
description of an Arthurian place, often referring to its 
legends, which they also spelt with their first or last 
letters. In the example, the words are all found around Merlin's 
house, "MERLIN'S GIANT MICRO UPON THE HEATH; THE WELL-KNOWN 
STANDING CIRCLE", and spell "STONEHENGE". 

(When this example was printed in the instructions, a zealous 
proof-reader removed the hyphen! STONEHELNGE? But people coped). 


The first four telephone clues were as follows. (Their answers 
are in brackets, but I've replacined each letter by the one 
before it in the alphabet - eg dwzlokd means example - so that 
you won't read them by accident): 

1. "Welcome to the Grail Hotline. The clue scent for October 17 
    to November 7 is one to savour. Don't let it drive you balmy 
    and remember that all smell that end smell." 
    (sgd hrsgrltr mzqqnvr sn z fqzrrx dwonrdc kzmc: shmszfdk).  

2. "Welcome to the Grail Hotline. The clue for November 8 to 
   December 6 is another chance to feather your nest. Remember, 
   a Grail in the hand is worth two in the bush." 
   Or "Fair are fowl, and fowl are fair. Hover on the wing 
   through the windy air". 
   (zqsgtq khdr cddo dmsnladc; qndjx ktlor dladkkhrg xnmcdq 
   dlnmdmbd'r czlo fqhsrsnmd drbzqoldms: zkcdqkdx dcfd). 

3. "Welcome to the Grail Hotline. The first two places were XXX 
   and YYY; the third is near Snowdon and its clues are linked 
   with fish." 
   (cdedmcdc hmgzahszshnm mdzq zmfkdrdx; rsnqlr dmrgqntc ldqkhm'r 
   qhbg xdkknv rdbqds). 

4. "Welcome to the Grail Hotline. Make sure you enter the last 
   part. The clues are linked with treasure, but you only need 
   the answer, which is a confused 'lost barn guy'." 
   (hmrohqhmf jmnkk. zqhlhsgdz inrdog'r kdes knmf-zfn gzvsgnqm 
   rgqta. xnt sntq zaadx). 

Number 4 was deliberately made a bit easier with the 'lost barn 
guy' addition, because people had found part 2 quite difficult 
(I think less than 9 people solved it and so they all went 
through to the final) and I wasn't sure whether we would have 
enough winners. But there was no problem. 

The finalists were: 

  P Armstrong, Tyne&Wear           N F Beric, Leics             
  Robert Blyth, Warwicks           P Brizell, Cheshire

  J Warrillow, Birmingham          M Young, Hants 


                            THE FINAL

The final was based on Arthurian general knowledge and intended 
to need quite a bit of research. The following is basically what 
was sent out to the finalists: 

"Your aim is to work out the name of the famous place where the 
Grail is 'hidden', and send this answer in by post. 

1) Each of the nineteen questions, A-S, has a one-word answer.  
   (To give some wrong examples, if the questing beast was sixteen 
   dog-power, Lancelot's father helped Arthur in Camelot, and the 
   four queens stand near Arthur's grave, the answers to A, B and 
   Q respectively would be 16, CAMELOT and QUEENS). 

2) Each of the answers is converted to a one-digit number:  
   * If it's a word, replace each of the letters by its position 
     in the alphabet (A=1,B=2,C=3 ... Z=26) and add them up. 
     So CAMELOT becomes 3+1+13+5+12+15+20 = 69. (If the answer is 
     already a number, you don't need this first stage of course). 
   * If the number is bigger than nine, add its digits together. 
     So 69 becomes 6+9 = 15. 
   * If the new number is still bigger than nine, repeat the 
     process until a one-digit number is left. 
     So 16 becomes 1+5 = 6. 
   * (So, taking the examples above: 16, CAMELOT and QUEENS would 
     become 7, 6 and 9). 

3) The answers from above build up into a 6-digit map reference (you 
   will have to guess the letters at the front of the reference), 
   using the following formula: 
                     First digit:  A+B-Q 
                     Second digit: C+D-O 
                     Third digit:  E+F-R 
                     Fourth digit: G-H+L 
                     Fifth digit:  I+J-P 
                     Sixth digit:  K+M-S 
   (Again, taking the incorrect example above, the first digit of 
   the map reference would be four: A+B-Q = 7+6-9 = 4). 

4) Use a map to find the name of the famous place at the map 
   reference. Write this down. 

5) The winner was basically the first person to find the grail 
   and write in. But each correct answer A-S was worth 1 day so 
   e.g a lucky entry with only 13 correct answers posted on the 
   10th would be beaten by one with 19 correct on the 15th. 

Here are the individual questions. You may need to refer to the 
Penguin English Library version of Le Morte D'Arthur, and to 
Arthurian books in general, but I promise that I have avoided 
obscure sources for the information. I wish you all luck. 

A. How many hound-power was the Questing Beast? 
B. Where did Lancelot's father greatly help Arthur? 
C. How many times did Lancelot rescue Guenever at the stake? 
D. How many brothers, or half-brothers, had Mordred? 
E. Which sword's name indicated it could cut steel? 
F. How many Round Table knights were there when the Grail 
   appeared at Pentecost? (In the original contest, I made the 
   mistake of asking how many saw it - and it was covered!) 
G. Who was also called Cuchullain? 
H. Who of Arthur's Grail Knights lived longest? 
I. What colour was a new knight's shield? 
J. What exactly was Lucy? 
K. What was Lancelot's real name? 
L. Emperors' bird.  
M. Arthurian namesake of computer. 
N. Assuming the celebrants of Mass were supernatural, how many 
   mortals saw the Grail in Castle Carbonek? 
O. Where was Geoffrey the writer from? 
P. Someone's original name was slightly changed to please the 
   French. What was it? 
Q. Who stand near Arthur's grave, between his sons and his quoit? 
R. Kind of tree which may have grown on the Isle of Avalon. 
S. The historical Arthur seems to have been a war leader similar 
   to Alfred the Great. How many centuries apart were they? 


                            SOLUTION 
          
John Sweeney found the grail in a week (which was just about as 
long as I had taken to work out the questions). He was good 
enough to provide the following notes to explain how he did it. 

(MDA and chapter numbers refer to Penguin edition of Le Morte 
D'Arthur. OAFK is The Once and Future King, 1967 Fontana Edition. 
Square brackets mark comments by Pete).
          
A The very first reference to the beast in MDA (I:19) is "thought 
   he heard a noise of hounds to the sum of thirty". But later in 
   the same paragraph it is "thirty couple", likewise in IX:12 and 
   X:13.  In the first reference Arthur only THOUGHT it sounded 
   like 30, and it was in the distance.  Therefore I assume that 
   the correct answer is 60.
          
B  Most sources seem to agree that Lancelot's father was Ban [of 
   Benwick]. Ban came to Arthur's aid in the great battle that
   took place near the Castle of Bedegraine. At the end of I:18, 
   MDA refers to this as "the battle of Bedegraine".
          
C  XVIII:4 - Guenever is to be burnt; XVIII:7 - Lancelot defeats 
   Mador to save her. XIX:9 "speak we of Queen Guenever that was 
   brought to a fire to be burnt"; Lancelot fought to prove her
   innocence and thus rescued her from the stake. XX:8 is titled 
   "How Sir Lancelot and his kinsmen rescued the queen from 
   fire..." 'nuff said?
          
   Or, OAFK p 502 "Lancelot was, in the end, to fight for the 
   Queen at the stake three times".
          
D  This all depends on who was actually Mordred's Mother and 
   Father! MDA gives his mother as Morgause, but most other 
   sources reckon on Morgana, some even going so far as to 
   suggest that even if, as in MDA, Morgause appears to be the 
   mother, it was still achieved by Morgana's witchcraft! But, 
   MDA says Morgause, so Morgause it is. In MDA Morgause has four 
   other sons: Gawain, Agravaine, Gaheris and Gareth (I:19).
          
   MDA leaves the relevation of Mordred's father till near the 
   end: XX:19 - "Sir Mordred was King Arthur's son" and XXI:1 
   "King Arthur begat you", though the second quotation does not 
   appear in the 1901 McMillan edition, presumably it is from the 
   Winchester Manuscript discovered in 1934. So, how many other 
   sons did Arthur have?  MDA gives us only Borre (I:17) but 
   Nennias and others mention Amr (also known as Anir) and there 
   is also a Llacheu. 

   I assume MDA is to be treated as the "bible" so I'll stick at 
   five! 
          
E  II:3 - Thank Heavens for the easy ones!
          
F  XIII:7 "it was so preciously covered" - sneaky!

   (Post-competition addendum:  apparently the answer required 
   here was 150 - the full complement of the Round Table - but 
   the question setters failed to note the words "covered with 
   white samite, but there was none might see it" and Galahad's 
   speech which started the Quest: "but one thing beguiled us, 
   we might not see the Holy Grail...wherefore...I shall labour 
   in the quest of the Sangrail." - this meant that my third map
   reference digit was wrong, but I decided to submit it anyway!) 
          
G  I thought we were sticking to "Lancelot - The Computer Game" 
   spellings!  [OAFK p 625 - "Gawaine...they would have 
   pronounced it Cuchullain in the North" - Note the "E"! - you 
   need to add the "E" or you get a negative map reference digit!]
          
H  What's a "Grail Knight"?  Since they all went looking for it 
   and there is no clear list of who they all were, I must assume, 
   for the question to make sense, that it means only those 
   knights who actually achieved or saw the Grail.
          
   The obvious choices are Bors, Galahad, and Percival, though 
   Lancelot got to see it a few times as well. Fortunately it is 
   well documented who died last of these:  XVII:23 "When Percival 
   and Bors saw Galahad dead" and "Sir Percival ... passed out of 
   this world ... Bors let bury him";  and as for Lancelot, XXI:12
   "when Sir Bors and his fellows came to his bed they found him 
   stark dead". So it is obviously Bors, right?
          
   BUT, what about Pelleas?  IV:28 - "Sir Pelleas ... was one of 
   the four that achieved the Sangrail" and XIX:11 - "... Nimue 
   ... wedded Pelleas, and she saved him that he was never slain"! 
   If he was never slain, thanks to Nimue's magic, then he must 
   surely be the the Grail Knight who lived longest!
          
   No? Well the notes in the Penguin Edition reckon tha the first 
   reference was due to confusion with King Pelles, and the second 
   reference doesn't discount the possibility of a natural death, 
   and Bors is still mentioned as being around in the last chapter 
   of MDA, so I suppose I'd better stick with Bors.
          
I  OAFK p 346 (apparently you should have a black bar on it if you 
   are a bastard!)
          
J  The Once and Future King p.203 (between Wart's second and third 
   attempts at the Sword in the Stone) refers to Luce. Luce or 
   Lucy is the Heraldic name for the Pike (fish, not weapon!).
          
K  XI:3 "he was named Galahad because Lancelot was so named at the 
   fountain stone".
          
L  Brittanica calls the eagle the "symbol of Empire" and Geoffrey 
   of Monmouth mentions it on page 251 in the Penguin Classics 
   edition - when Arthur is fighting the Emperor Lucius the 
   Emperor uses a golden eagle as his standard.  [And OAFK p 329 
   - "an emperor was allowed an eagle" for hawking.]
          
M  BT market a PC Clone called a "Merlin" - if that is not an 
   "Arthurian Namesake" I don't know what is!  There also used to 
   be a "Dragon" computer, and dragons occur, occasionally, in 
   MDA. But "Archimedes" makes the co-ordinate sums work, so 
   Archimedes it must be!
   
   [Archimedes is Merlin's Owl in OAFK, and Acorn have used an 
   owl symbol since BBC Micro. When the owl symbol was due to 
   be inherited by their new computer, I cannot believe they were 
   unaware of the reference]. 
       
N  Hmmm. Is Carbonek the same as Corben(ic)? Does Lancelot count 
   since he saw the Grail in Pelles' castle back in XI:2? (And 
   in XVII:15.) Best to discount these for two reasons: first, 
   XI:2 mentions "all that were there" without any further detail 
   and would therefore make the question unanswerable; second, the
   question refers to a supernatural celebration of Mass, which 
   presumably implies that we are only interested in the events 
   around XVII:19.
          
   Everybody leaves apart from the three knights (Bors, Galahad, 
   and Percival), King Pelles, Eliazar and an unnamed maid 
   (Pelles' neice) - "and so these three fellows and they three 
   were there, no more". OK six so far.
          
   Then in come some more knights, three each from Gaul, Ireland, 
   and Denmark (the four corners of the world?!). That makes 15.
          
   Then in comes the Maimed King, deposited by four gentlewomen 
   who leave. Sixteen.
          
   Pelles and Eliazar are told to leave as they are not of the 
   quest - very specific: "There be two among you that be not in 
   the quest of the Sangrail". What about the niece?  Surely she 
   wasn't in on the quest. Ah! well - looks like she is still 
   there. That makes fourteen.
          
   [Apparently the question setters decided to count Lancelot - 
   so the correct answer is 15.]
          
O  At last another easy one!  Geoffrey of Monmouth wrote his 
   History of the Kings of Britain in 1136.
          
P  Yeucch!  They all had their names changed slightly as their 
   stores were retold in different languages:
          
               Morrigu - Morgan
               Myrddin - Merlin
               Bedwyr - Bedivere
               Galaad  - Galahad
               Gwalchmai - Gawain
               Gwenhwyfar - Guenever
               Yugerne - Igraine
               Cei - Kay
               Lanzelot - Lancelot
               Medraut - Mordred
               Parsifal - Percival
               Drystan - Tristram
               Yseut - Isolde
               etc.
          
               Which one was changed to please the French?  Well, the
               only specific reference I can find is in "Albion: A
               Guide to Legendary Britain" which claims that the
               Modron was changed to Morgan by the Bretons.
          
               [Apparently the correct answer is Myrddin because it
               could be mispronounced as Merde-in and Merde is not a
               very nice word in French, not a very nice word at all!]
          
          Q    The Prescelly Hills - nice one!  Did you know there are
               at least 11 of Arthur's Quoits in the British Isles?
          
          R    Another nice easy one - why can't they all be like
               this!
          
          S    The historical Arthur was most likely late Fifth
               Century or early Sixth century.  Alfred was Ninth
               Century.  So is it three or is it four?
          
               Most of the events in the historical Arthur's life
               probably took part in the 6th Century.  Alfred lived in
               the 9th.  9 - 6 = 3?  Yes, but the dates aren't too
               precise, even ignoring the date on the Seige Perilous
               in MDA (454 years after the passion of Our Lord), there
               is still the problem that the use of dates based on the
               birth of Christ weren't introduced until the Synod of
               Whitby in 664.  For example Annales Cambriae (c. 960)
               referred to the Battle of Mount Badon as Year 72 and
               Arthur's death as Year 93, but doesn't say when Year 1
               was!
          
               Most analyses seem to put Badon between 489 and 518,
               though basing it on Bede and Gildas probably says no
               later than 503, and Arthur's death between 515 and 542.
               He was supposedly only 15 when he came to the crown,
               shortly before Badon, so was he born in the 470s?
               Alfred was born around 848, crowned in 871 and died in
               899 (probably!).  So each of the important dates for
               the two monarchs (birth, coronation, death) were almost
               certainly seperated by more than 350 years.  Rounding
               up gives four centuries difference.  This is more
               mathematically correct, so I'll go for it!
