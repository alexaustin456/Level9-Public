; MESSAGE.TXT, messages for the game: C64 tape version. 
; 
; Messages are of the form: [ number : text ] ; comment 
; They must be in numeric order, but gaps are allowed in the number 
; sequence, of course. 
; 
; | (vertical bar) terminates the printable part of a message. It 
;   is typed by shifting backslash (to the left of the keyboard). 
; / forces the following character to be printed literally. 
; % is carriage return. Note that carriage return is ignored if 
;   the printing is already at the start of a line, to make coding 
;   simpler. To force a real carriage return, print space first. 
; ^ (shift 6) marks a word for recognition by the parser. It is 
;   followed by a letter for word type: 
;   Adjective; Comment; conJunction; Noun; Preposition; Verb. 
; 
; Capitalization is done automatically on output and you are 
; recommended to use lower case for the first letter of messages 
; as this improves compression and will make no difference on 
; output, providing all punctuation is correct.

[601:the second best knight in the world, now that his son

YOU could tell that he retained the strength of youth with sword 
and lance, and combined it with the valuable wisdom of his middle 
years]  
; Lancelot. ** CLUE 5 ** ; ** CLUE 9 ** 
; 
[602:a knight, clad in full ^N armour, as huge and black as 
any bear. He held his lance UNDER his arm and glowered at 
Lancelot] ; black knight. 
; 
[603:a wise old man, well steeped in faith and philosophy. He 
needed no sword nor axe, for his knowledge of hidden SECRETS was 
power enough] ; Nacien the hermit. ** CLUE 9 ** 
; 
[605:a stolid man, not clever but deep-thinking nonetheless. He 
strove always to do that which was right, to live always in 
accord with his sense of chivalry and Christian duty. He was a 
brave knight and well respected in the jousts, a fair but 
fearless fighter] ; Bors. 
; 
[606:a parfait gentle knight, good-hearted and innocent in the
 ways of the world] ; Percival. 
; 
[607:a sturdy knight with a ^N surcoat and ^N shield of deepest 
blue and green, the design and colours echoing the patterns of 
light and shade in the forest. Seated in the sunlight, he reminded 
Lancelot of Arthur's FATHER-IN-LAW, at one with the woodland 
around] ; knight who wants to know L's name. ; ** CLUE 8 ** 
; 
[608:the best knight in world, in chivalry and virtue surpassing 
even Lancelot, his father. His armour shone brilliantly, as if 
with an inner light. With 
his long ^N spear of white ash he cut a striking figure - one 
that WON hope for those in distress] ; Galahad. ** CLUE 9 ** 
; 
[609:more than two score knights clad in dark, unpolished 
^N armour and mounted on dark, dirty ^N horses. In each mailed 
fist was ESPY'D a ^N battle-axe, ^N mace, ^N spear or ^N sword, 
poised to strike without honour or mercy at any who stood in their 
way. For all there were so many of them, no human sounds came 
from that company] ; Knights who kidnap Galahad ** CLUE 9 ** 
; 
[610:an aged man with a kindly, florid face and wisps of 
thin grey hair frilling his woollen ^N skull ^N cap. He 
wore a black ^N tabard over his white ^N robe with a thick 
leather ^N belt around his ample waist] ; false preacher. 
; 
[611:a pitiful sight. He lay prostrate upon the ground, so wasted 
by sun and wind that his flapping robe seemed as if it BELONGED 
to a much bigger man. From time to time, he would muster his 
failing strength to utter a pained murmur of "Water, water"] 
; pilgrim. ; ** CLUE 8 ** 
; 
[613:a most comely and alluring young woman, slender and 
well-made. Lancelot wondered what was the point of CHIVALRY as 
he looked at her ^N skin, fair and soft as a gentle breeze, 
her ^N eyes, blue and clear as a Summer sky, and her lustrous 
^N tresses, as golden as shimmering sunlight. Her ^N garments 
were of the finest silk from distant Arabie, and her ^N dress 
clung gently to the soft contours of her body and caressed her 
shapely legs] ; tempting damosel. ** CLUE 8 ** 
; 
[614:a thin, shabby figure of a man, wearing a thin, patched 
^N robe. The garb and the tonsure showed he was a cleric; a 
pale, pinched face and scrawny neck told of frequent hunger. 
Yet for all 
his obvious poverty and suffering, he had the air of a man of 
unbroken spirit, of stoic endurance of the pains of this world 
and hope for the future] ; cleric. 
; 
[615:a group of Benedictine monks, tall and short, thin and 
fat but all with matching ^N tonsures and brown ^N robes. 
They waited patiently, knowing all would come to pass in 
time] ; priests. 
; 
[625:ferocious beasts, slashing at the air with savage 
^N claws, black ^N lips drawn back and red-rimmed ^N jaws 
agape as they roared their bloodlust. They stared and 
lunged at Lancelot with murderous intent] ; lions. 
; 
[626:a huge dragon, red as the fires of Hell, with a great 
barrel of a ^N body and a long snaking ^N neck. A double row 
of murderous sharp ^N vanes stood up the length of his back 
and down his massive ^N tail. His foul, fiery breath scorched 
the earth around] ; red dragon. 
; 
[627:an evil travesty of a human shape. The leathered ^N skull, 
with its serpentine ^N tongue and eyes of flame, menaced from 
beneath the shimmering black ^N cowl of its foul ^N robe that 
surged and writhed about its rattling ^N body. Taloned 
^N fingers reached grasping towards Lancelot] ; fiend from tomb. 
; 
[628:a great black beast, wreathed in thick, dark smoke that 
gushed from its ^N nostrils and rose in plumes from the living 
furnace of its body. Its barbed ^N wings stretched out, 
darkening the sky and casting night's gloom upon the 
ground] ; black dragon. 
; 
[629:untouchable, invisible. Knowable only by the great sense 
of evil that it engendered] ; can probably never examine fiend. 
; 
; 
; now some ordinary objects (80 onwards).. 
; 
[680:an INSPIRING crown of gold, beset with ^N rubies and 
^N emeralds, and topped with a ^N diamond as big as a mailed fist. 
A great treasure, and a clearly a source of great power] 
; tempting crown. ; ** CLUE 5 **

engraved with nude ^N figures all about its scalloped edges]
