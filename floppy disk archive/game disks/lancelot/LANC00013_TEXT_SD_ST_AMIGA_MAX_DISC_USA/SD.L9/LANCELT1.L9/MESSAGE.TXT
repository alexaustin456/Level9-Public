; MESSAGE.TXT, messages/keywords for the game. 
; 
; ST version 
; 
; Messages are of the form: [ number : text ] ; comment 
; They must be in numeric order, but gaps are allowed in the number 
; sequence, of course. 
; 
; | (vertical bar) terminates the printable part of a message. It 
;   is typed by shifting backslash (to the left of the keyboard). 
; / forces the following character to be printed literally. 
; % is carriage return. Note that carriage return is ignored if 
;   the printing is already at the start of a line, to make coding 
;   simpler. To force a real carriage return, print space first. 
; ^ (shift 6) marks a word for recognition by the parser. It is 
;   followed by a letter for word type: 
;   Adjective; Comment; conJunction; Noun; Preposition; Verb. 
; 
; Capitalization is done automatically on output and you are 
; recommended to use lower case for the first letter of messages 
; as this improves compression and will make no difference on 
; output, providing all punctuation is correct. 
;

welcome sight. He was a large man and bore his heavy armour 
with an easy grace] ; Lancelot 
; 
[602:a fair-faced and richly dressed young fellow. Though

prefer the pleasures of the court. His skill upon the harp

; 
[603:a handsome and well-set young knight, but with an air that

nonetheless] ; Sir Bors de Ganis 
; 
[605:a cantankerous old fellow, bluff and hearty] ; Sir Pedivere

to his friends, but unforgiving to those who did him 
wrong] ; Sir Gawain 
; 
[607:wearing a surcoat of red. Red too were his shield and the 
plumes on his helm and, had his helm been removed, then could you

above his men] ; the Red Knight 
; 
[608:a small knight who fussed overmuch in matters of

and valorous nature] ; Sir Ector de Maris

dark man with a weasel-like face] ; Sir Agravain 
; 
[612:a knight of towering strength and proud demeanour who held 
himself aloof from his fellows] ; Sir Aliduke 
 ;

Whether from fleas or from habit, he was ever scratching 
himself] ; Sir Brandiles

; 
[615:brother to Sir Gawain, with the same flaming hair and hot 
temper] ; Sir Geheris

[617:the young nephew of Lancelot; a nervous youth, whose 
fingernails were bitten to the quick] ; Sir Lionel 
; 
[618:an older knight with a lined face which told of many

[638:a bedraggled-looking pauper] ; beggar
; 
[639:an overstuffed official, striding about like a mountain of 
flesh as he did his job] ; town crier ** CLUE 7 ** 
;
[652:a motley lot. Their hands and faces were exposed to the 
grime of the farmyard, and a strong smell of the stables hung 
about them. Some muttered to each other, while others just 
stared into the distance] ; peasants ** CLUE 1 ** 
; 
[653:gathered to watch the execution. A dirty, ill-dressed mob, 
they waited with malicious pleasure to see the downfall of one

thought deeply, if slowly, and strove ever to be a goodly king

[662:a fusty old wizard of strange garb and manners. He wore a 
dark purple robe patterned with swirls that seemed to move of 
their own accord and in its many huge pockets he kept all manner 
of objects and small animals, such as he might need for his 
sorcery. Merlin's long, tangled beard was mottled with many

long forgotten. Oftimes he muttered to himself incomprehensibly, 
seeming to live in a world apart from mortal men]

[2493:knighted Lancelot, and bade him stay and dine with them. 
As they sat at table and the drinks flowed, Lancelot stole many 
a glance at Queen Guenever. Truly, he thought, she was a most 
beautiful and stately woman. And as the evening wore on, it came 
to him that he was fast losing his heart to her. 
%At times, their eyes met and Guenever did look away coyly, 
like a maiden. At length, with his heart in his mouth, he 
essayed to beg of her the favour of being her champion. As 
he had feared, she refused for that she should not be 
championed by a novice, and for a dreadful moment Lancelot 
thought she would rebuff him entirely. 
%But then Guenever smiled knowingly at him and bade him to 
return to her when he had proved himself to be worthy of her 
favour. At this, Lancelot was drunken with pride and joy, 
and swore he would not fail, but would go to Logris without 
delay, there to honour Guenever with noble deeds and battles 
chivalrously won. 
%Sithen Arthur looked upon Lancelot and said, "There are sieges 
yet to be filled at this Round Table, and knights of which I 
have heard - all honourable fellows, the which I need - who 
are held captive by rebel lords who live beyond my rule. Now, 
could you but bring them to Camelot as free men, that would 
prove you to be a full worthy knight"]

he might slay Sir Meliagaunt where he knelt. Then the Queen drew 
herself up to her full height, and insisted that Lancelot should 
spare him. As it was late, Guenever made it known that she would 
spend the night at Meliagaunt's castle. But she made it clear 
that Lancelot would be on hand to protect her and that her 
knights would sleep outside her door.

sprang to her defence, and challenged Meliagaunt to a battle for 
the Queen's honour. Sir Meliagaunt curled his lip at the young 
knight and accepted the challenge, setting the time for three 
days thence. Sweeping up his weapons, he called the castle 
guards, ordered the window to be secured, and left angrily with 
the Queen, clutching her tightly by the arm]

fight only when Lancelot offered to take off half his armour and 
have one hand tied behind his back. This was done, and the two 
did come to fight. 
%"This will take but a moment!" called 
Meliagaunt, and so it did. For Lancelot taunted Meliagaunt with 
his naked side, and when the other did lunge at him, Lancelot 
stepped apace and with one mighty blow, clove Meliagaunt in two, 
even down to his breastbone.

the tale of Meliagaunt's treachery and cowardice. Then he said 
quietly to Lancelot, "Gramercy for defending the honour of my 
Queen, and ridding us of that wicked knight". But a shadow of 
anxiety passed across his face as he spoke, and did not leave him 
afterwards]

saving only one, and life proceeded apace at court. Lancelot 
lived happily, always triumphing in the many tournaments that 
were held, performing valiant deeds on the hunts, and oftimes 
taking pleasure in secret with Guenever. 

% %Full twenty years passed thuswise, until a prophecy appeared 
above the one yet empty seat at the Round Table, the Siege 
Perilous. This read, FOUR HUNDRED WINTERS AND FOUR AND FIFTY 
ACCOMPLISHED AFTER THE PASSION OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST OUGHT 
THIS SIEGE TO BE FULFILLED. And so it was, for Galahad the Haut 
Prince arrived at Camelot that very day, and the company was 
complete. 

% %That evening, the Holy Grail appeared to the knights, as is 
described in the book. But it departed all too soon and the 
most part of the company swore to find its resting place and 
perhaps bring the Grail back to Camelot. 

% %Lancelot knew that he must put aside earthly pleasures and 
see Guenever no more. He retired to his chamber to prepare 
for the events of the morrow, setting aside his armour and 
weapons for the moment. But he knew he could not, in honour, 
leave without saying goodbye to his love]
