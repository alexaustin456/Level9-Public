
The Quest for the Holy Grail

The quest for the Sangrail continued for many years, and all the knights who set out to seek the Holy vessel had many marvellous adventures, but none more than Sir Launcelot who had seen the Grail at Castle Carbonek, or Galahad whose destiny was to fulfil the quest.

Launcelot rode hard for several days, until he came unto an old chapel, where he thought to find himself rest. He tried to enter therein, but could only reach the altar, richly arrayed in silk and with six great candles set into a fair silver candlestick. He could find no entry to the chapel itself and at last, tired and dismayed, laid himself to sleep on his shield at a stony cross outside.

He was half wakened some time after when two fair white palfreys rode up to the cross. The palfreys bore a litter which carried a sick knight, that moaned in pain for the Sangrail to come to heal him.

Launcelot stirred, still half asleep, for it seemed to him thathe could not rise into wakefulness, and he espied the candlestick from the altar carry itself, as if floating, unto the cross. It was followed by a silver table, and the shining holy vessel of the Sangrail, although Launcelot could see none that was bearing it aloft. He heard the sick knight sit up and welcome the Sangrail, and he saw kneel down to the ground to touch the vessel and kiss it. Then the knight rose up again whole and healed. The Sangrail remained at the cross for a long while before it glided back into the chapel, and yet still had Launcelot no power to follow it.

After some hours Launcelot woke fully. He recalled how the sick knight had been healed, but it was as though it were all a dream. And even as he thought this, a voice came to him, and told him to withdraw from the holy place in which he had been sleeping, for he was unworthy.

Launcelot was sore unhappy and wept at these words, and the more unhappy still when he discovered that his horse and helm and sword had been taken away by the healed knight, yet he knew well the message. "My sin and wickedness have brought me unto great dishonour. When I sought worldly adventures and worldly desires, I achieved them. Now I have taken up a holy adventure and my old sin has come back to shame me, so that I have no power when holy blood appears before me." 

With much sorrow, Launcelot departed from the cross on foot and went unto a hermitage where the hermit would hear his confession. The hermit counselled Launcelot that his shame in God's eyes had to do with his sinful love for Guenever, and that he should forswear his lust for her. And Launcelot fully repented of his earthly sins, and with the hermit's blessing set out to start his quest afresh.

After many months, Launcelot came unto the water of Mortaise, where he laid down to rest and a vision came to him in his sleep, which told him to enter the first ship that he could find. Launcelot arose and went to the strand where he found a ship without either sail or oar and he entered and a great feeling of peace and joy overwhelmed him, and  he remained with the ship for over a month.

Then one day, somewhat weary of the small ship, he was sitting on  the shore when he heard a thundering of hooves, and a most seemly looking knight on a fair horse galloped up to the shore. He dismounted and taking his saddle and bridle with him, went straight into the ship.

Launcelot followed, curious about this self-assured young man, and made himself known to the young man, whereupon the knight revealed that he was Sir Galahad, Launcelot's own son. There was much rejoicing between them as the two embraced, and told each other of their adventures.

Galahad had ridden from Camelot into strange lands which he knew not. Many adventures befell him and always he was successful in his endeavours and gained much in knightly experience. He had defeated many knights in fair combat, he had given support to the defenders in a great siege at a castle, and with their comrades Sir Bors and Sir Percival, he had been set adrift to sea in a boat which had beached them in the marches of Scotland, there to do battle with many knights who had challenged them. 

Launcelot made great joy to hear his tales. His own quest had been tortuous and hard, with little success and he took much pride in his son. For a full six months, Launcelot and Galahad voyaged together in that boat, encountering many perilous adventures.

But never did they come near the Sangrail, that was the true nature of their quest and so Galahad then left the ship to seek the vessel as he was ordained.

The did Sir Launcelot make much sorrow, for he was alone and downhearted, but he prayed daily to God that he might still see some tidings of the Sangrail. The ship carried him over the sea, he knew not whereto, but trusted it to steer him safely.

After a month at sea, the ship beached at midnight at the back of a rich looking castle. A postern opened out towards the sea and a voice seemed to bid Launcelot to enter in. Anon Launcelot ran to his arms, and armed him and went to the gate, for here, so he thought, might at last be his adventure.

He entered the castle without challenge, but inside he could find no door or gate which would open, howsomever hard he tried. Behind one door he could hear sweet and reverent singing from inside the chamber, and he knew full well that the Sangrail was in that room. He fell to his knees and prayed to God to show him at least some part of the Grail.

He looked up from his prayers and was filled with awe to see the chamber door swing slowly open. From inside shone out a great light, that was the clearest, purest light Launcelot had ever seen. The knight rose quickly and walked determinedly towards the room, when a voice commanded him, "Flee Launcelot  and enter not. It is not for thee to enter, and thou shalt regret it if thou dost."

Launcelot withdrew, full heavy of heart. He looked up and into the chamber, and there was the silver table, and the Holy Grail covered in red samite and all the ornaments of an altar, and a priest who seemed to celebrating mass.

And Launcelot could not bear to stay outside, and taking a deep breath, he strode into the room where the Grail was.

But he could not get to it. As he entered, a scorching wind pummelled his face, seeming to burn him, and he fell to the ground, half-senseless, so that he felt he had no power to get upand no power of seeing or hearing. His body would not move, and then he felt hands all about him, that carried him out of the room and left him in the passageway.

The next morning the people of the castle found Launcelot's body outside the chamber door. They felt his pulse and could find no movement in it and many thought he was dead, save one who declared that they should care for him. So he was taken to a bedchamber and tended, where he lay for four and twenty days and as many nights before he even so much as stirred.

He awoke on the twenty fifth day, and learned that he was in the Castle of Carbonek. He learned too from the people of the castle that he had achieved as much of the Sangrail as he would ever see, and Launcelot understood and thanked God for that which he had been allowed to see. 

When Launcelot was fully recovered, he  determined to return to King Arthur and Camelot and relate his adventures.

The court at Camelot was pleased to see Launcelot but it was a smaller court than before, for more than half of the Knights of the Table Round had been slain in the quest. The King was eager to hear tidings of Galahad and Launcelot told him all of their adventures until the day that Galahad had left the boat.

Galahad, since departing from the ship, had had many adventures but they seemed to be of no avail for they never brought him to the Sangrail. One day, while with Sir Percival, they came out of a great forest, and anon crossed the path of Sir Bors. The three of them then rode together until they came to the castle Carbonek. When they entered within, King Pelles was full joyful to see them, for he knew that now the quest for the Grail would be achieved.

King Pelles, his son Eliazar and the three Grail knights sat down to dinner, but before they could eat, a voice came them. "There are two among you that are not in the quest for the Sangrail, and therefore you both should depart."

King Pelles stood up. The moment had come, and with a single look at Galahad he and his son slipped away. Scarce had they gone, when a man and four angels appeared before the knights. The angels set the man down before a table of silver and on the table the Sangrail appeared. The man, who was dressed as a bishop, set about the ritual of the celebrating of mass. He kissed Galahad and bade Galahad kiss his fellow knights, which he did and then the bishop vanished away.

The three knights sat at the table in full dread of what might next happen. They looked up and saw a man come out of the holy vessel, a man with open wounds bleeding freely, as did those of Jesus Christ, and he offered the holy vessel to Galahad. Galahad knelt and received his Saviour, and Our Lord then told Galahad that he must depart with Bors and Percival the next morning to the sea, where he would find a ship ready and waiting for him.

On the morrow, the three knights set off, and after three days came to a rivage where they found a ship waiting for them. On board the ship they found a table of silver and the Sangrail covered in a cloth of red samite. The three knelt down and prayed with much reverence.

The ship took them across the water to the city of Sarras. They disembarked and taking the table of silver went into the city, where they remained for a full twelvemonth. On that day at the year's end, the man in the likeness of a bishop came to Galahad  and Bors and Percival and he had the Holy Grail with him. They celebrated mass, and the man revealed himself to the knights as Joseph, son of Joseph of Arimathea, and now Galahad knew that his time on earth was near an end.

Galahad kneeled before the table which held the Holy vessel and made his prayers, and as he did so, his soul departed quickly and quietly to Jesus Christ. The watching Percival and Bors perceived a great multitude of angels take it up to heaven. They saw too that a great hand came down and took the Vessel and bore that up to heaven as well. And this was the last that any earthly man saw of the Sangrail.
