

The Death of Arthur 

Now that the Sangrail had been achieved and all the knights that still lived after their perilous journeys across land and sea in the quest had come back unto the Table Round, it seemed that the kingdom would be as great as it had been before. 

But Sir Launcelot soon forgot his repentance and his vows of the quest and soon he began to resort unto Queen Guenever again, and truly the love that was between them was so great that they spent many hours together privily.

The sin that was between the queen and the knight cleaved the court of King Arthur into two hostile groups, just as Merlin had prophesied, and because of Merlin's warnings, Arthur knew that his reign over England  was nearly over.

None felt anger about the love between Launcelot and Guenever more bitter than  Sir Gawain, which was great pity for they were once the truest of friends. 

But Gawain was set full hard against the knight, for Launcelot had, in battle for defence of Guenever, and all-unknowing slain Gawain's brothers, Gareth and Gaheris, and for that deed Gawain swore to be avenged. Where once there had been friendship and trust, now there was only enmity. 

Eventually Launcelot left Arthur's court altogether, and voyaged to his lands in France. He took loyal knights with him, and gave them exulted titles and great lands in that country. And Arthur knew with a heavy heart that he would have to make war on Launcelot, who had taken his wife in sin and defied his rule. 

For himself, Arthur desired only peace with Launcelot, for he had loved him well in earlier days. But Arthur listened to the counsel of Gawain, who was his half-brother. And Gawain was mad for vengeance against the fair knight.

So at the request of Gawain, Arthur concluded to do battle against Launcelot, and when his knights departed from England for Bayonne, he made Sir Mordred chief ruler of England in his absence, for Sir Mordred was his own natural son. And Arthur also put his wife Queen Guenever under Mordred's governance.

In France, King Arthur's men laid waste to great tracts of land, and at last they reached Bayonne and Launcelot himself. 

Now Gawain, in his madness for revenge, sought out Launcelot every day, and every time, he was left sore wounded. And Gawain would surely have died of his many half-healed wounds if this had continued, but Arthur had some news from England, which was of a nature more pressing and more important than the battle against Launcelot.

Sir Mordred, for all that he was Arthur's natural son, was a bad and evil knight. He was weak of character and jealous of heart, and he sought only to have the throne for himself. 

All the while Arthur was waging battle in France, Mordred made mischief at home. He forged letters the which he said hadd been sent from France, and in them he wrote tidings of Arthur's death in battle against Sir Launcelot. 

After he had made these letters public, he called all the remaining lords together, and made them chose him as the next king, and had himself crowned at Canterbury.

This angered the Archbishop greatly, and he warned Mordred that his deeds were  impious. Mordred defied him and threatened to have him slain, so the Archbishop fled and went nigh into a chapel near Glastonbury where Mordred could not find him.

Next Mordred announced his intention of taking Guenever as his queen.

Guenever was passing heavy at this, for she did not desire to make marriage with Mordred, but she durst not speak her heart. Butshe told him she had to go unto London to buy all manner of things for their wedding. Mordred trusted her well and gave her leave to go, whereupon she went straight to the Tower of London, and stocked it with food to last a long siege and boarded up all the entrances. Mordred, wroth out of all measure, laid siege to the tower, but for all his mighty assaults, she would not come out.

When Arthur heard of all these deeds, he summoned his knights anon, and turned for England to be avenged upon Mordred. Mordred's spies sent word to him that Arthur was coming back unto Dover, and Mordred drew the English people to him by force. And so, when Arthur and his knights landed at Dover, there was his own son and his army ranged against him at the shore.

The battle between them was bloody and vicious, but Arthur's courage and his men's prowess prevailed and although many good knights died, Arthur's armies were victorious. Mordred fled inland.

But for Sir Gawain, it was his last battle. He had fought bravely and nobly against Mordred, but the many wounds that he had got against Launcelot had made him weak and he was near death when Arthur came unto him. Ere he died, Gawain repented of his quarrel with Launcelots and wrote unto him a letter of peace. Then he was buried in Dover Castle.

Now the people drew unto Arthur, for was not Mordred an aggressor against the rightful king? Arthur moved his camp to Salisbury, and his armies increased as people came to his side. Yet Mordred was also able to raise more men, for those who were loyal to Launcelot drew unto Mordred.

A third battle was assigned for Salisbury on the day after Trinity Sunday. The night before, Arthur could not sleep; his heart was heavy with the decline of his kingdom and the enmity of Launcelot. At last he fell to sleeping fitfully, and as he slept he dreamed, and it seemed that Gawain appeared to him in the night.

Gawain was a ghostly figure accompanied by a number of fair ladies, and he had a warning for Arthur. "I have come to warn you of your death," said the Gawain of Arthur's dream. "If ye fight with Mordred as ye both have assigned, doubt not that ye will be slain. God hath sent me to you to counsel you to make a treaty with Mordred for a month, and put the battle into a delay. For within that month Sir Launcelot and all his noble knights will come to England to your rescue, and to slay Mordred."

When Arthur woke, the dream was still vivid in his mind, and he called his two most trusted knights remaining, Sir Bedevere and Sir Lucan, and charged them to make this treaty with Mordred.

After some hours, Bedevere and Lucan returned from Mordred to say that there would be a truce. It was agreed that the two leaders should meet on Salisbury Field, and each should bring just fourteen knights to affirm the treaty.

Ere they departed,Arthur warned his host: "We are not going to do battle, but if ye see any of Mordred's men draw his sword, then attack with all speed and slay Mordred, for I do not trust that man."

Mordred too was wary: "If ye see any of Arthur's knights draw a sword, set upon them fiercely, for I do not trust this treaty and I know my father desires revenge upon me," he told his men.

And so the two parties met, and formally agreed the treaty. Wine was fetched for all to drink, but they were all tense and watchful of the opposing knights.

And it so chanced that an adder slithered out of a heath bush, and it bit one of the knights on the foot. When this knight felt the sting, he looked down and spied the adder. And without thinking, he unsheathed his sword and killed the adder. Yet all the other knights that had been so wary saw the point of the sword glinting in the sun, and suddenly all was bugles blowing and trumpeting, and the two hosts set upon each other in grim earnest.

This battle was the most doleful of them all, fought with deadly intensity. For a whole day the fighting raged, and when evening drew in there were at least a hundred thousand knights lying dead upon the field. In utter despair, Arthur looked about him. Of his once proud and noble army, he could see only Lucan and Bedevere still standing.

And then he was ware of Mordred, leaning on his sword among his own dead and wounded. And Arthur took his spear and rushed at him. Mordred turned round and drew his sword to meet him and the two clashed.Arthur smote Mordred, and ran him through. And when Mordred knew that this was the death wound, he summoned up his might to thrust his sword at Arthur's helmet. The sword went through the metal, and pierced Arthur's skull. It was Mordred's last earthly deed.

Lucan and Bedevere carried the grievously wounded king to a nearby chapel. Lucan was sorely wounded, and when he lifted Arthur up, he fell to the gorund himself. From the great battle of Salisbury, there was now only Arthur and Bedevere left.

The king turned to Bedevere. "I have not much time left," he said painfully. "Therefore, take my sword Excalibur and throw it into yonder lake ."

Bedevere took the jewelled sword and went down to the lakeside. He could not see the good in Arthur's request, and was sure that to abandon such a noble weapon would be a great loss. So he hid it behind a tree.

"I have done as you ask," he told Arthur. 

"What saw thou at the lake?" asked Arthur. 

"Sir," replied Bedevere, "I saw nothing but waves and the wind on the water." 

"Then thou art lying," said Arthur heavily. "Go again and this time, do my commandment, and quickly, for thy tarrying is putting my life in jeopardy."

So Bedevere returned to the lake, and took up the sword and after a moment's hesitation, hurled it as far into the depths as he could. As he looked across the water, he saw a fair arm and a hand rise out of the lake and it caught the sword as it fell. The hand brandished the sword three times and then it vanished. He came again to Arthur and told him of this strange sight. Arthur was satisfied. He charged Bedevere to take him down to the lakeside, where  a barge drew alongside the water's edge. 

In the little barge were a number of fair ladies, all with black hoods, and when they saw King Arhur they wept and keened greatly. Bedevere placed the weakened king into the barge, where the ladies received him with great mourning. 

Arthur struggled to speak. "Bedevere, I must go into the vale of Avilion to be healed of this wound, and if thou should never hear of me again, pray for my soul." And Bedevere watched the barge as it sailed away, until he could no longer make it out against the horizon.
