^N Cauldrons of steaming ^N water hung within the ^N fireplace, 
and a huge ^N pile of great ^N towels was set upon a ^N shelf to

[1120:. It was very dark, but Lancelot could make out a large 
^N bed with a plump ^N mattress. ^N Tattered ^N drapes of

behind them. Their DEEP ^N shadows moved like ^N strange ^N birds] 
; in the perilous bedroom ** CLUE 2 **

; 
[1123:, a ^N squat ^N building, with a ^N simple ^N wooden ^N cross

; 
[1129:. The ^N branches were much slimmer here and full of ^N sap,

from some old ^N oak ^N casks set by the ^N wall. A ^N pile of 
^N dusty ^N hempen ^N sacks lay heaped against a great 
^N chest. Some sacks had split, spilling little ^N mounds of 
^N barley on to the ^N floor] ; in the basement  
; 
[1136:, cut through ^N crumbling ^N shale, the ^N roof held up in

; in an upper prison 
; 
[1145:, a ^N grassy ^N stretch, pocked with ^N stagnant

; 
[1147:. It had fallen into ruin and the ^N grounds, that 
had once been neatly ordered, were rank and overgrown with 
^N foul ^N weeds] ; outside a manor house 
; 
[1148:. The ^N dense ^N growth of ^N tall ^N pines, soaring straight  
up like ^N spires, cut out the ^N sunlight from the ^N forest ^N 
floor. The ^N ground was softly carpeted with ^N pine ^N needles 
and strewn with ^N cones] 
; in forest Meliot

[1152:. The ^N long ^N straight ^N highway stretched 
east-west as far as the ^N eye could see and had been 
laid with ^N flat ^N stones, though ^N weeds now sprouted 
plentifully in the ^N cracks. The ^N turret threw a ^N long 
^N dark ^N shadow across the ^N way] ; Roman 
; road beside a turret 
;  
[1153:. The ^N track split into two here, both the western and 
northern being ^N paths of trampled rotting ^N leaves, although 
the western of them looked somewhat drier 
underfoot] ; at a junction in the forest  
; 
[1154:, a ^N squat ^N tower built of small ^N stones mortared 
together. A ^N heavy ^N shutter hung beside the ^N narrow

; 
[1155:. The ^N cool ^N dusk of the ^N forest gave way to a ^N sunny  
^N meadow sprinkled with ^N buttercups and ^N cowslips, and 
humming with ^N bees and other ^N insects. A ^N small ^N castle 
stood beyond the meadow, bathed in the warm glow of the evening

[1156:. Once wide and true but now broken and overgrown, it was 
made treacherous by ^N tangled ^N thorns that stretched out to
catch the unwary] ; Roman road through thorns 
;  
[1157:, a ^N straight ^N wide ^N track stretching deep into the 
^N forest, with the ^N treetops arching high overhead. It was rutted 
and worn, but the ^N worst of the ^N holes had been filled with 
^N rubble and ^N broken ^N stones] ; on a Roman road through forest 
; Sauvage 
;  
[1158:. Wide and even, it traversed the ^N whistling MOOR or followed 
alongside ^N rivers. And as a ^N narrow ^N stony ^N track it wound 
around ^N hills or descended into ^N wooded ^N vales] 
; great north road ** CLUE 6 ** 
;  
[1159:. It was a ^N fine ^N highway to the north, and fully paved

[1160:, a ^N low ^N east-west ^N causeway through the ^N marshes] 
; on the coast road 
;  
[1161:, the ^N headland jutting out fiercely into the ^N foaming 
^N ocean below. Atop the ^N sheer ^N ESCARPMENT rose the ^N dark 
^N grey ^N castle, surrounded by wheeling seagulls. Its 
^N battlements commanded the sea approaches from ^N Wales and 
the ^N lands of north ^N Cornwall behind. The ^N country to the 
south was green and gently rolling, at odds with the ^N harsh 
^N coast|^N Castle] ; at Tintagel ** CLUE 2 ** 
; 
[1162:. The ^N dry ^N stone ^N wall was the home for dozens of

; road 
; 
[1164:, where ^N scattered ^N outcrops of ^N rock pushed  
up from the ^N golden ^N sand, leaving ^N deep ^N pools at

^N dunes to ^N rolling ^N fields beyond, and curved round 
in a ^N wide ^N bay ending in tall ^N headlands] ; on a beach 
; 
[1166:, covered in ^N short ^N coarse ^N grass, the ^N peak a 
^N bare  ^N head of hard ^N granite. The ^N slopes were dotted with

^N tracks wove all between] ; on a hill  
; 
[1167:, which ran through ^N thickly ^N wooded ^N river ^N valleys,

the ^N tops of ^N bleak ^N moors, oftimes following the ^N course 
of their ^N ridges] ; on a winding road  ** CLUE 3 ** 
;  
[1168:, the which was much used. The ^N ground was worn 
and pitted with ^N footmarks and gouged by ^N horses ^N hooves. A 
small ^N patch of ^N straggling ^N grass marked the ^N centre of the  
^N crossing. Here a ^N smooth ^N round ^N boulder had once served as 
^N signpost, but the ^N directions carved thereon had been worn away by 
wind and rain] ; at a crossroads  
; 
[1169:. This land was like unto a ^N great ^N boulder, set as 
a ^N stepping-stone in the sea. Atop its ^N peak was a ^N dark 
^N tower] ; on an ^N island 
;  
[1170:. From here a ^N narrow ^N track led up, past a slender ^N tower 
built upon a ^N rocky ^N hill, and on towards a ^N village. There  
could be seen ^N squat, ^N solid ^N cottages and a ^N small ^N stone 
^N church] 
;  
[1171:, an INHABITATION where the people ate mainly fish. A 
^N cluster of ^N tiny ^N stone ^N houses around the 
^N castle. Their ^N doors faced inland, and ^N smoke blew 
furiously from the ^N chimneys. A few sparse ^N strips of 
^N farmed ^N land could be seen behind the ^N cottages]

circled slowly above its ^N tall ^N sharp ^N  towers. 
It had the air of a place accursed]

growing thick and high on both ^N sides] ; on a forest road  
; 
[1198:. The ^N ground squelched underfoot, and ^N bitterns boomed 
their hollow cries from amid the coarse ^N reed ^N beds. A ^N  
castle stood upon an ^N outcrop of solid ^N rock that rose from 
the flat lands beyond. It was strong and well-built, yet, rising 
out of the ^N marshy ^N mists, it had a semblance of insubstantiality  
about it, as though its ^N solid ^N walls hovered above the ground] 
; on a reedy isle beside a castle 
;  
[1199:. ^N Oily ^N stagnant ^N pools gave way to brown shifting ^N mud, 
with sparse ^N tufts of ^N grasses struggling for a ^N foothold 
in the slippery oozing ^N lands. The ^N ground was flat and  
without feature for as far as the ^N eye could see, and a ^N grey 
^N mist hung over all] ; in a trackless marsh 
;  
[1200:. Raised above the ^N level of the ^N brackish ^N mud ^N flats, 
and marked out with ^N pebbles, the ^N track was yet boggy and 
difficult to follow] ; on a marsh road  
; 
[1201: where the road ended. There were ^N high ^N mounds, 
and ^N trenches deep and wide enough for the passage of 
mounted ^N Knights. Above this ^N waste ^N chaos towered the 
entrance portals of ^N Castle ^N Lyonesse] ; at a siegeworks 
;  
[1202:, a ^N clearing encompassed by Autumn ^N trees. The ^N grass 
was as full of ^N bright ^N poppies as a ^N harvest ^N field]

The ^N grass was as trampled and scored as a tournament ground] 
; in the black launds 
;  
[1205:. Once a major ^N meeting of the ^N road with another 
from the east, it had been little used for many a long year. 
^N Grass grew across all the ^N tracks, and wild

Lancelot had to push between their 
^N branches] ; at a country junction

^N growth overflowed the ^N western ^N roadside] ; on a country road  
; 
[1208:, paved with large ^N flagstones, laid flat and even. ^N 
Mosses and small ^N ferns grew in the ^N gaps in the ^N stones,

across the ^N face, and fallen ^N trees lay across the ^N track,  
blocking all ways but south] ; on an overgrown road 
; 
[1211:. The ^N round tower looked but a ^N poor ^N fortress, but

;  
[1214:. A STEEP ^N path passed above the gurgles of a ^N stream. 
The ^N path followed a twisting route along ^N ridges and 
across the gentler ^N slopes. Then it climbed steeply to the

wall, built many long years since to keep out the wild tribes of 
the north. Now it lay unused, its ^N battlements reduced in part 
to ^N rubble. Yet elsewhere it still LIES strong, for eagles to 
perch upon] ; in the marches ** CLUE 2 ** 
; 
[1219:. In the clearing stood on ^N old ^N apple ^N tree, its ^N  
branches casting ^N welcome ^N shade on the ^N trimmed ^N grass beneath, 
its ^N blossom sweeting the air. Above the ^N encompassing ^N wood 
rose the ^N battlements and ^N conical ^N roofs of castle
