; MESSAGE.TXT, messages/keywords for the game. 
; 
; ST Version 
; 
; Messages are of the form: [ number : text ] ; comment 
; They must be in numeric order, but gaps are allowed in the number 
; sequence, of course. 
; 
; | (vertical bar) terminates the printable part of a message. It 
;   is typed by shifting backslash (to the left of the keyboard). 
; / forces the following character to be printed literally. 
; % is carriage return. Note that carriage return is ignored if 
;   the printing is already at the start of a line, to make coding 
;   simpler. To force a real carriage return, print space first. 
; ^ (shift 6) marks a word for recognition by the parser. It is 
;   followed by a letter for word type: 
;   Adjective; Comment; conJunction; Noun; Preposition; Verb. 
; 
; Capitalization is done automatically on output and you are 
; recommended to use lower case for the first letter of messages 
; as this improves compression and will make no difference on 
; output, providing all punctuation is correct.

[601:the second best knight in the world, now that his son 
Galahad stood first among the flowers of chivalry. The lumpy, 
mis-shapen face of he who called himself the Ill-Made Knight, 
had weathered with the years so that the nobility of his 
character shone through his ugliness. His tall, broad frame 
was spare of all fat but close-clad in tough, sinewy muscles. 
In his middle years, he retained the strength of youth and 
combined it with the experience and wisdom of age] ; Lancelot. 
; 
[602:a knight, clad in full ^N armour, as huge and black as 
any bear. More than a head taller than Lancelot, and mounted 
on a massive ^N charger, the knight was a glowering tower of 
menace. Deep within the darkness of his ^N helm, his hooded 
eyes glimmered a challenge, a challenge echoed in his stance 
and in the tilt of his mighty ^N lance] ; black knight. 
; 
[603:a wise old man, well steeped in faith and philosophy. His 
pale blue eyes, part-hidden beneath the outcrop of white, bushy 
eyebrows, would oftimes stare piercingly at Lancelot as if 
looking at his soul deep within. Othertimes they would grow 
opaque and take a distant focus while he communed with his 
thoughts and with his Maker. He was clad in a ^N robe of brown 
worsted, ragged at the hem and sleeves, and patched roughly at 
the knee. The hood was pushed back, exposing a fluffy halo of 
white hair around his tonsured pate. From his ^N belt hung a 
plain wooden ^N cross, worn shiny where his gnarled fingers 
had stroked it in prayer] ; Nacien the hermit. 
; 
;; [604:a brave knight] ; Ector. 
; 
[605:a stolid man, not clever but deep-thinking nonetheless. He 
strove always to do that which was right, to live always in 
accord with his sense of chivalry and Christian duty. He was a 
brave knight and well respected in the jousts, a fair but 
fearless fighter] ; Bors. 
; 
[606:a parfait gentle knight, good-hearted and innocent in the forest. Mounted on his nut-brown ^N steed, 
he waited patiently, at one with the woodland 
around] ; knight who wants to know L's name. 
; 
[608:the best knight in world, in chivalry and virtue surpassing 
even Lancelot, his father. He was a most handsome young man, with 
a comeliness that could have broken the hearts of a thousand fair 
damosels had he not forsworn all worldly pleasures. For Galahad 
was pledged to purity and piety in his quest for the Holy Grail. 
His armour shone brillia in the forest. Mounted on his nut-brown ^N steed, 
he waited patiently, at one with the woodland 
around] ; knight who wants to know L's name.

[608:the best knight in world, in chivalry and virtue surpassing 
even Lancelot, his father. He was a most handsome young man, with 
a comeliness that could have broken the hearts of a thousand fair 
damosels had he not forsworn all worldly pleasures. For Galahad 
was pledged to purity and piety in his quest for the Holy Grail. 
His armour shone brilliantly, as if with an inner light, and with 
his long ^N spear of white ash he cut a striking figure - one to 
bring hope to those in distress and striking fear in the souls of 
evil-doers] ; Galahad. 
; 
[609:more than two score knights clad in dark, unpolished 
^N armour and mounted on dark, dirty ^N horses. Each mailed 
fist clutched a ^N battle-axe, ^N mace, ^N spear or ^N sword, 
poised to strike without honour or mercy at any who stood in 
their way. For all there were so many of them, few human 
sounds came from that company] ; Knights who kidnap Galahad. 
; 
[610:an aged man with a kindly, florid face and wisps of 
thin grey hair frilling his woollen ^N skull ^N cap. He 
wore a black ^N tabard over his white ^N robe with a thick 
leather ^N belt around his ample waist. A silver ^N rosary 
was attached by a chain to that belt, but was at that 
moment clasped between his pink hands as he raised them 
in prayerful greeting] ; false priest. 
; 
[611:a pitiful sight. He lay prostrate upon the ground, his 
dusty robe flapping loosely on his wasted frame. From a ragged 
sleeve protruded a calloused, bony hand, the torn fingers 
scratching weakly at the dry earth. His face was caked with 
dust and grime, glazed eyes flickered dully from beneath 
drooping lids, his swollen tongue press listlessly against 
dry cracked lips. From time to time, he would muster his 
failing strength to utter a pained murmur of "Water, water"]

; 
[613:a most comely and alluring young woman, slender and 
well-made. Her ^N skin was as fair and soft as a rose petal, 
her ^N eyes as blue and clear as a summer's sky, her lustrous 
^N tresses as golden as shimmering sunlight. Her ^N garments 
were of the finest silk from distant Arabie, and her ^N dress 
clung gently to the soft contours of her body and caressed her 
shapely legs. She carried herself erect, poised and confident, 
but not aloof, and when she walked it was with a rhythmic 
elegance, joyous to behold] ; tempting damosel. 
; 
[614:a thin, shabby figure of a man, wearing a thin, patched 
^N robe. The garb and the tonsure showed he was a cleric; a 
pale, pinched face and scrawny neck told of frequent hunger;

his obvious poverty and suffering, he had the air of a man of 
unbroken spirit, of stoic endurance of the pains of this world 
and hope for the future] ; cleric.

; 
[626:a huge dragon, red as the fires of Hell, with a great

of murderous sharp ^N vanes stood up the length of his back 
and down his massive ^N tail. His foul, fiery breath scorched 
the earth around] ; red dragon. 
; 
[627:an evil travesty of a human shape. The leathered ^N skull,

beneath the shimmering black ^N cowl of its foul ^N robe that 
surged and writhed about its rattling ^N body. Taloned 
^N fingers reached grasping towards Lancelot] ; fiend from tomb. 
; 
[628:a great black beast, wreathed in thick, dark smoke that

with no crew upon its ^N deck, no hand upon its ^N tiller. 
Magic ^N spindles of green, white and red all made of the wood
