[601:the second best knight in the world, now that his son 
Galahad stood first among the flowers of chivalry. 
You could tell that he retained the strength of youth with sword

two elder men learned full well that the sword would give only for 
Arthur, they both knelt down to the earth before him. 

Arthur was greatly dismayed. "My own father and brother!" he 
exclaimed. "Why do ye kneel before me?"

"Nay, Arthur, I am not your father, nor of your blood" said Sir 
Ector gently, and for the first time he told him how Merlin had

[611:a pitiful sight. He lay prostrate upon the ground, so wasted

Leodegrance was right. The gift of a hundred knights and the Table 
Round pleased Arthur far greater than land, and he sent out Merlin 
to find fifty accomplished knights to complete the number, the

Merlin and Nimue 
---------------- 

For all that he was a magician and a soothsayer, Merlin fell in 
love with one of the ladies of the lake, called Nimue. He became 
besotted upon her and could not bear to be away from her, and she

And because of his excellence, Queen Guenever favoured him above 
all other knights, and he too favoured her, and many of his great 
knightly deeds were done for love of Guenever.

Sir Lancelot was riding in Corbin, when he saw the fairest tower he 
had ever seen. Inside was a lady, enchanted to remain in scalding 
water until the best knight in the world should take her hand.  
Launcelot rescued her; she thanked him and he thought she was the 
fairest lady in the world,reetedThisTurn ; prevent Arthur talking to everyone at once
