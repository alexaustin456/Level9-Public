t the child should be named Galahad; that he 
would become the best of all knights, surpassing even his father; 
and that he would be worthy of the Holy Grail. Yet how could it be 
done, fair though Elaine was, when every man knew that Lancelot 
kept himself only for love of the Queen Guenever?

Then Dame Brisen, one of the greatest enchantresses that lived at 
the time, came unto Pelles, and told him that she could work this 
thing by using her crafts.

Lancelot was given wine, the which had Brisgled with

to make him blinded with lust, and when he was taken unto Elaine's 
chamber, he thought that she was Guenever, and lay with her until 
morning.

Elaine knew well that the child she carried from that night was 
born to be the noblest knight in the world, and when he was born, 
she christened him Galahad, and kept him well and nourished him. 
But Lancelot was shamed by the trickery, and left the castle that 
same morning to continue his travels.

Some months after, Arthur decreed that a feast be held.

Elaine deemed it right that she should attend the feast and bring 
the baby Galahad with her. She came with her servant Dame Brisen, 
and a retinue of twenty knights, and was so richly attired that all 
of Camelot agreed she was the fairest lady ever seen in that court. 
All, that is, save Lancelot, for fear of Guenever's fury.

Elaine was heavy of heart that Lancelot would not speak kindly to 
her, nor look at her, and went unto Brisen for advice. The

The other knights were greatly inspired by this and ere Gawain had 
sat down, each of them had risen and made vows such as he had done. 
And as they were rejoicing and making great plans for their quest, 
only Arthur was still and silent. 

For Arthur remembered the prophecies and teaching of the soothsayer 
Merlin, and he knew that many of his knights would never return, 
and the Table Round would never be restored.



The Quest for the Holy Grail 
---------------------------- 

The quest for the Holy Grail continued for many years, and all the 
knights who set out to seek the Holy vessel had many marvellous 
adventures, but none more than Sir Lancelot who was to see the Grail 
at Castle Carbonek, or Galahad whose destiny was to fulfil the 
quest.

Lancelot rode hard for several days, until he came unto an old 
chapel, where he thought to find himself rest. He tried to enter 
therein, but could only reach the altar, richly arrayed in silk and 
with six great candles set into a fair silver candlestick. He could 
find no entry to the chapel itself and at last, tired and dismayed, 
laid himself to sleep on his shield at a stony cross outside.

He was half wakened some time after when two fair white palfreys 
rode up to the cross. The palfreys bore a litter which carried a 
sick knight, that moaned in pain for the Holy Grail to come to heal 
him.

Lancelot stirred, still half asleep, for it seemed to him that he 
could not rise into wakefulness, and he espied the candlestick from 
the altar carry itself, as if floating, unto the cross. It was 
followed by a silver table, and the shining holy vessel of the 
Holy Grail, although Lancelot could see none that wa the ^N trees 
stunted and clad with ^N grimy ^N leaves]

endeavors and gained much in knightly experience. He had defeated 
many knights in fair combat, he had given support to the defenders 
in a great siege at a castle, and with their comrades Sir Bors and 
Sir Percival, he had been set adrift to sea in a boat which had 
beached them in the marches of Scotland, there to do battle with 
many knights who had challenged them. 

Lancelot made great joy to hear his tales. His own quest had been 
tortuous and hard, with little success and he took much pride in 
his son. For a full six months, Lancelot and Galahad voyaged 
together in that boat, encountering many perilous adventures.

But never did they come near the Holy Grail, that was the true 
nature of their quest and so Galahad then left the ship to seek the 
vessel as he was ordained.

The did Sir Lancelot make much sorrow, for he was alone and 
downhearted, but he prayed daily to God that he might still see 
some tidings of the Holy Grail. The ship carried him over the sea, 
he knew not whereto, but trusted it to steer him safely.

After a month at sea, the ship beached at midnight beside a fine 
castle. A postern opened out towards the sea and a voice bade 
Lancelot to enter in. Anon, Lancelot armed himself and went to the 
gate, for here, so he thought, might at last be his adventure.

As he neared the castle, Lancelot saw two lions on guard. He drew
his sword, but it was smitten from his hand and a voice chided his 
evil faith, that he put more trust in weapons than in his Maker. 

He entered the castle without further challenge, but inside he could 
find no door or gate which would open. But behind one door he could 
hear sweet and reverent singing, and he knew full well that the Holy 
Grail was in that room. Lancelot fell to his knees and prayed to God 
to show him at least some part of the Grail.

He looked up from his prayers and was filled with awe to see the 
chamber door swing ^N stained ^N glass and filled the 
chamber with the colours of glory]

three of them then rode together until they came to the Castle 
Carbonek. When they entered within, King Pelles was full glad to see 
them, for he knew that now the quest for the Grail would be achieved.

King Pelles, his son Eliazar and the three Grail knights sat down 
to dinner, but before they could eat, a voice came them. "There are 
two among you that are not in the quest for the Holy Grail, and 
therefore you both should depart."

King Pelles stood up. The moment had come, and with a single look 
at Galahad he and his son slipped away. Scarce had they gone, when 
a man and four angels appeared before the knights. The angels set 
the man down before a table of silver and on the table the Holy 
Grail appeared. The man, who was dressed as a bishop, set about the 
ritual of the celebrating of mass. He kissed Galahad and bade 
Galahad kiss his fellow knights, whice oceans. Even from the masthead

time on earth was near an end.

Galahad kneeled before the table which held the Holy vessel and 
made his prayers, and as he did so, his soul departed quickly and 
quietly to Jesus Christ. The watching Percival and Bors perceived a 
great multitude of angels take it up to heating a 
lonely track through a vast empty sky. ]

her and the twain left Logris for Lancelot's lands in France. 

For himself, Arthur desired only peace with Lancelot, for he had 
loved him well in earlier days. But Arthur listened to the counsel 
of Gawain, who was his nephew. And Gawain was mad for vengeance, for 
Lancelot had slain his bretheren in the rescue.

So Arthur took his army to France, leaving Sir Mordred to rule 
England in his absence, for Sir Mordred was much dust, for it had not 
rained for many a day. ] ; ** CLUE 8 **

At last he fell to sleeping fitfully, and as he slept he dreamed, 
and it seemed that the ghost of Gawain appeared to him.

"I have come to warn you of your death," said the Gawain of Arthur's 
dream. "If ye fight with Mordred as ye both have assigned, doubt not

received him with great mourning. 

Arthur struggled to speak. "Bedevere, I must go into the vale of 
Avalon to be healed of this wound." And Bedevere watched the barge

Epilogue 
-------- 

When Queen Guenever heard that Arthur was slain, and of the 
bloodshed on Salisbury Field, she stole away quietly to a nunnery at 
Almesbury, and spent the rest of her days in penance for her sins.

As Gawain had prophesied in Arthur's vision, Lancelot landed at 
Dover within a month, having heard of Mordred's treachery.

He was too late to save Arthur, but was determined to see his lady 
Guenever again. For seven days he was on the road and on the eighth 
he came to a nunnery. As he entered the cloister, a nun dressed all 
in black and white saw him there and swooned.

They spoke together for a short time, and when Lancelot saw that 
Guenever had taken to a life of penance, he decided orSingleMessage,2679 ; hi hubby!

TRIPLE-FORMAT DISCS (AS USED FOR LANCELOT)
------------------------------------------

    The increasing variety of home micros, and the tendency of 
publishers to bring out many individual versions of each game for 
them, poses problems for retailers and players alike. 

Basically, it is difficult for any shop to stock all the machine 
versions of even the more popular games. 

Fortunately, there is a u can wait for someone or a period of time, eg WAIT FOR 
GALAHAD, WAIT 1 or WAIT FOR 25 MINUTES)]

[2301:%please insert save disc and press a key. %] 
[2302:%please insert gamebeen done.. 

    Traditional dual-format discs, whether flippies or otherwise, 
have in effect one version of the game on side A and the other on B. 
This is obviously wasteful of space, as both copies of the game have 
to fit on one disc. 

    Level 9's triple-format discs are different, with just one copy 
of the game, filling most of the disc. There is a small amount of 
machine-specific code to handle things which differ, like disc 
access and picture display.
