; MESSAGE.TXT, messages/keywords for the game. 
; 
; ST Version 
; 
; Messages are of the form: [ number : text ] ; comment 
; They must be in numeric order, but gaps are allowed in the number 
; sequence, of course. 
; 
; | (vertical bar) terminates the printable part of a message. It 
;   is typed by shifting backslash (to the left of the keyboard). 
; / forces the following character to be printed literally. 
; % is carriage return. Note that carriage return is ignored if 
;   the printing is already at the start of a line, to make coding 
;   simpler. To force a real carriage return, print space first. 
; ^ (shift 6) marks a word for recognition by the parser. It is 
;   followed by a letter for word type: 
;   Adjective; Comment; conJunction; Noun; Preposition; Verb. 
; 
; Capitalization is done automatically on output and you are 
; recommended to use lower case for the first letter of messages 
; as this improves compression and will make no difference on 
; output, providing all punctuation is correct.

Well, we got tired of waiting for someone else to do a proper job, 
so here's our faithful interpretation of the Arthurian saga. And, 
putting this on one side, I think it's our best game to date. I 
hope you enjoy it. 
 


"Lancelot" is based on Sir Thomas Malory's "Le Morte D'Arthur", 
published by William Caxton in 1485, as one of the first books to 
use modern printing.  

"Le Morte D'Arthur" was an amalgamation of Arthurian stories ish while wearing

n to reward Merlin in his turn. The noble knight assented 
that Merlin should have whatever he desired if he could make Uther 
whole again.

Merlin rode to Uther's pavilion, where he told the king that Uther 
might spend the night with Igraine, for by Merlin's magic, he would 
appear to her in the likeness of her husband. In return, Uther must 
deliver any child, born of their union, for the magician to raise.

Uther could not hold his patience, and rode out with his party for 
Tintagel at once. Tput, e.g for

he espied, to his joy, a sword. It was stuck through an anvil, set 
upon a wide marble stone, and glittered in the winter sunlight.

"I will take that sword," Arthur decided. "My brother Sir Kay shall 
not be without a sword today of all days". He grasped it firmly and 
found that it came easily out of the anvil. Hurrying after his 
party, he never noticed the words that were written in gold about 
the sword.

[601:the second best knight in the world, now that his son

and lance, and combined it with the valuable wisdom of his middle 
years]

[602:a knight, clad in full ^N armour, as huge and black as 
any bear. He held his lance under his arm and glowered at

needed no sword nor axe, for his knowledge of hidden secrets was 
power enough] ; Nacien the hermit. ** CLUE 9 ** 
; 
;; [604:a brave knight] ; Ector. 
; 
[605:a stolid man, not clever but deep-thinking nonetheless. He 
strove always to do that w with all their might, but it would not move. When the 
two elder men learned full well that the sword would give only for 
Arthur, they both knelt down to the earth before him. 

Arthur was greatly dismayed. "My own father and brother!" he 
exclaimed. "Why do ye kneel before me?"

"Nay, Arthur, I am not your father, nor of your blood" said Sir 
Ector gently, and for the first time he told him how Merlin had 
delivered him to Sir Ector as a newborn baby, and charged him to 
nourish Arthur as his or's father-in-law, at one with the woodland 
around] ; knight who wants to know L's name. ; ** CLUE 8 ** 
; 
[608:the best knight in world, in chivalry and virtue surpassing 
even Lancelot, his father. His armour shone brilliantly, as if 
with an inner light. With 
his long ^N spear of white ash he cut a striking figure - one 
that won hope for those in distress] ; Galahad. ** CLUE 9 ** 
; 
[609:more than two score knights clad in dark, unpolished 
^N armour and mounted on dark, dirty ^N horses. In each mailed 
fist he espied a ^N battle-axe, ^N mace, ^N spear or ^N sword, 
poised to strike without honour or mercy at any who stood in their 
way. For all there were so many of them, no human sounds came 
from that company] ; Knights who kidnap Galahad ** CLUE 9 ** 
; 
[610:an aged man with a kindly, florid face and wisps of 
thin grey hair frilling his woollen ^N skull ^N cap. He 
wore a black ^N tabard over his white ^N robe with a thick 
leather ^N belt around his ample waist] ; false preacher. 
; 
[611:a pitiful sight. He lay prostrate upon the ground, so wasted 
by sun and wind that his flapping robe seemed as if it belonged 
to a much bigger man. From time to time, he would muster his 
failing strength to utter a pained murmur of "Water, water"] 
; pilgrim. ; ** CLUE 8 ** 
; 
[613:a most comely and alluring young woman, slender and 
well-made. Lancelot wondered what was the point of chivalry as 
he looked at her ^N skin, fair and soft as a gentle breeze, 
her ^N eyes, blue and clear as a Summer sky, and her lustrous 
^N tresses, as golden as shimmering sunlight. Her ^N garments 
were of the finest silk from distant Arabie, and her ^N dress 
clung gently to the soft contours of her body and caressed her 
shapely legs] ; tempting damosel. ** CLUE 8 ** 
; 
[614:a thin, shabby figure of a man, wearing a thin, patched 
^N robe. The garb and the tonsure showed he was a cleric; a 
pale, pinched face and scrawny neck told of frequent hunger. 
Yet for all 
his obvious poverty and suffering, he had the air of a man of 
unbroken spirit, of stoic endurance of the pains of this world 
and hope for the future] ; cleric. 
; 
[615:a group of Benedictine monks, tall and short, thin and 
fat but all with matching ^N tonsures and brown ^N robes. 
They waited patiently, knowing all would come to pass in 
time] ; priests. 
; 
[625:ferocious beasts, slashing at the air with savage 
^N claws, black ^N lips drawn back and red-rimmed ^N jaws 
agape as they roared their bloodlust. They stared and 
lunged at Lancelot with murderous intent] ; lions. 
; 
[626:a huge dragon, red as the fires of Hell, with a great 
barrel of a ^N body and a long snaking ^N neck. A double row 
of murderous sharp ^N vanes stood up the length of his back 
and down his massive ^N tail. His foul, fiery breath scorched 
the earth around] ; red dragon. 
; 
[627:an evil travesty of a human shape. The leathered ^N skull, 
with its serpentine ^N tongue and eyes of flame, menaced from 
beneath the shimmering black ^N cowl of its foul ^N robe that 
surged and writhed about its rattling ^N body. Taloned 
^N fingers reached grasping towards Lancelot] ; fiend from tomb. 
; 
[628:a great black beast, wreathed in thick, dark smoke that 
gushed from its ^N nostrils and rose in plumes from the living 
furnace of its body. Its barbed ^N wings stretched out, 
darkening the sky and casting night's gloom upon the 
ground] ; black dragon. 
;

of evil thh was given to me by Uther 
Pendragon. The Table will seat a hundred and fifty knights when it 
is full, and I will myself send a hundred good knights."

Leodegrance was right. The gift of a hundred knights and the Table 
Round pleased Arthur far greater than land, and he sent out Merlin 
to find fifty accomplished knights to complete the number, the 
while he made preparations for the royallest wedding he could 
devise. But Merlin could only find forty eight knights of enough 
prowess to grace the Table Round, and so there were two empty seats.

Then Merlin, by his magic craft, made each of the names of the
knights appear in gold lettering in their places at the table, and 
in just two places was there no name.

As the knights came to Camelot, where the King was wedded unto 
Guenever, Arthur set out them their duties as Knights of the Table 
Round. He charged them never to commit treason or murder, never to 
be cruel, never to enter into battle for a wrongful reason 
whatsoever the reward, but ever to grant mercy when it was asked 
for, and ever to help ladies, whether gentlewomen or damosels, 
whenever succour was needed. And every Knight was sworn to this 
oath and every year at Pentecost they affirmed it again.



Merlin and Nimue 
---------------- 

For all that he was a magician and a soothsayer, Merlin fell in 
love with one of the ladies of the lake, called Nimue. He became 
besotted upon her and could not bear to be away from her, and she 
kept in his company until he har the best knight in the Land. Its 
^N cognizance was a blood red cross on a background of virgin 
white] ; Galahad's shield. ; ** CLUE 5 **

Then one day Merlin showed her a rock, inside which were marvels 
wrought by enchantment. Nimue tricked Merlin by subtlety and made 
him go underneath the rock, to tell her of the marvels, and then, 
by use of the crafts which he had taught her, she enclosed the rock. 

Merlin was not harmed, and spoke happily enough to passing knights, 
but, no matter what charms Merlin practised to assay to open up the 
rock, he remained that the cup stood a little out of kilter] ; cup.

And because of his excellence, Queen Guenever favoured him above 
all other knights, and he too favoured her, and many of his great 
knightly deeds were done for love of Guenever.

Sir Lancelot was riding in Corbin, when he saw the fairest tower he 
had ever seen. Inside was a lady, enchanted to remain in scalding 
water until the best knight in the world should take her hand.  
Launcelot rescued her; she thanked him and he thought she was the 
fairest lady in the world,he world was flooded. It was covered 
over with a ^N cloth of sheerest white ^N samite. It waited by 
the shore, riding the tide effortlessly with no crew upon its 
^N deck, no hand upon its ^N tiller. Magic ^N spindles of green, 
white and red all made of the wood of the Eden tree, hung from 
a great ^N bed that lay within. As Lancelot looked upon the 
barge, he sensed the holy power that was vested in it, and knew 
that its guide must needs be a more worthy knight than he] 
; magic barge. ** CLUE t the child should be named Galahad; that he 
would become the best of all knights, surpassing even his father; 
and that he would be worthy of the Holy Grail. Yet how could it be 
done, fair though Elaine was, when every man knew that Lancelot 
kept himself only for love of the Queen Guenever?

Then Dame Brisen, one of the greatest enchantresses that lived at 
the time, came unto Pelles, and told him that she could work this 
thing by using her crafts.

Lancelot was given wine, the which had Brisgled with

Elaine knew well that the child she carried from that night was 
born to be the noblest knight in the world, and when he was born, 
she christened him Galahad, and kept him well and nourished him. 
But Lancelot was shamed by the trickery, and left the castle that 
same morning to continue his travels.

Some months after, Arthur decreed that a feast be held.

Elaine deemed it right that she should attend the feast and bring 
the baby Galahad with her. She came with her servant Dame Brisen, 
and a retinue of twenty knights, and was so richly attired that all 
of Camelot agreed she was the fairest lady ever seen in that court. 
All, that is, save Lancelot, for fear of Guenever's fury.

The other knights were greatly inspired by this and ere Gawain had 
sat down, each of them had risen and made vows such as he had done. 
And as they were rejoicing and making great plans for their quest, 
only Arthur was still and silent. 

For Arthur remembered the prophecies and teaching of the soothsayer 
Merlin, and he knew that many of his knights would never return, 
and the Table Round would never be restored.



The Quest for the Holy Grail 
---------------------------- 

The quest for the Holy Grail continued for many years, and all the 
knights who set out to seek the Holy vessel had many marvellous 
adventures, but none more than Sir Lancelot who was to see the Grail 
at Castle Carbonek, or Galahad whose destiny was to fulfil the 
quest.

Lancelot rode hard for several days, until he came unto an old 
chapel, where he thought to find himself rest. He tried to enter 
therein, but could only reach the altar, richly arrayed in silk and 
with six great candles set into a fair silver candlestick. He could 
find no entry to the chapel itself and at last, tired and dismayed, 
laid himself to sleep on his shield at a stony cross outside.

He was half wakened some time after when two fair white palfreys 
rode up to the cross. The palfreys bore a litter which carried a 
sick knight, that moaned in pain for the Holy Grail to come to heal 
him.

Lancelot stirred, still half asleep, for it seemed to him that he 
could not rise into wakefulness, and he espied the candlestick from 
the altar carry itself, as if floating, unto the cross. It was 
followed by a silver table, and the shining holy vessel of the 
Holy Grail, although Lancelot could see none that wa the ^N trees 
stunted and clad with ^N grimy ^N leaves]

;; [1021:on a path]

[1234:. The ^N stony ^N waste 
stretched out both east and west as far as the eye could see. 
To the north it was bounded by a ^N high ^N cliff, its ^N rugged 
^N face crossed by a ^N thin ^N straggling ^N path. Southwards, 
a patch of ^N dusty ^N greenery told of water and human habitation] 
; 
;; [1035:on a stony road] 
[1235: that tracked through the ^N wasteland. His horse picked 
a careful passage between the ^N hard ^N flints and ^N troublesome 
^N pebbles]

[1236: of smooth ^N sward] 
; 
;; [1037:besige lands which he knew 
not. Many adventures befell him and always he was successful in his 
endeavors and gained much in knightly experience. He had defeated 
many knights in fair combat, he had given support to the defenders 
in a great siege at a castle, and with their comrades Sir Bors and 
Sir Percival, he had been set adrift to sea in a boat which had 
beached them in the marches of Scotland, there to do battle with 
many knights who had challenged them. 

Lancelot made great joy to hear his tales. His own quest had been 
tortuous and hard, with little success and he took much pride in 
his son. For a full six months, Lancelot and Galahad voyaged 
together in that boat, encountering many perilous adventures.

But never did they come near the Holy Grail, that was the true 
nature of their quest and so Galahad then left the ship to seek the 
vessel as he was ordained.

The did Sir Lancelot make much sorrow, for he was alone and 
downhearted, but he prayed daily to God that he might still see 
some tidings of the Holy Grail. The ship carried him over the sea, 
he knew not whereto, but trusted it to steer him safely.

After a month at sea, the ship beached at midnight beside a fine 
castle. A postern opened out towards the sea and a voice bade 
Lancelot to enter in. Anon, Lancelot armed himself and went to the 
gate, for here, so he thought, might at last be his adventure.

As he neared the castle, Lancelot saw two lions on guard. He drew
his sword, but it was smitten from his hand and a voice chided his 
evil faith, that he put more trust in weapons than in his Maker. 

He entered the castle without further challenge, but inside he could 
find no door or gate which would open. But behind one door he could 
hear sweet and reverent singing, and he knew full well that the Holy 
Grail was in that room. Lancelot fell to his knees and prayed to God 
to show him at least some part of the Grail.

He looked up from his prayers and was filled with awe to see the 
chamber door swing ^N stained ^N glass and filled the 
chamber with the colours of glory]

three of them then rode together until they came to the Castle 
Carbonek. When they entered within, King Pelles was full glad to see 
them, for he knew that now the quest for the Grail would be achieved.

King Pelles, his son Eliazar and the three Grail knights sat down 
to dinner, but before they could eat, a voice came them. "There are 
two among you that are not in the quest for the Holy Grail, and 
therefore you both should depart."

King Pelles stood up. The moment had come, and with a single look 
at Galahad he and his son slipped away. Scarce had they gone, when 
a man and four angels appeared before the knights. The angels set 
the man down before a table of silver and on the table the Holy 
Grail appeared. The man, who was dressed as a bishop, set about the 
ritual of the celebrating of mass. He kissed Galahad and bade 
Galahad kiss his fellow knights, whice oceans. Even from the masthead

time on earth was near an end.

Galahad kneeled before the table which held the Holy vessel and 
made his prayers, and as he did so, his soul departed quickly and 
quietly to Jesus Christ. The watching Percival and Bors perceived a 
great multitude of angels take it up to heating a 
lonely track through a vast empty sky. ]

of Gawain, who was his nephew. And Gawain was mad for vengeance, for 
Lancelot had slain his bretheren in the rescue.

[1416:an angry roar rumbled from the woods to the south and

The final battle was assigned for Salisbury on the day after Trinity 
Sunday. The night before, Arthur could not sleep; his heart was 
heavy with the decline of his kingdom and the enmity of Lancelot. 
At last he fell to sleeping fitfully, and as he slept he dreamed, 
and it seemed that the ghost of Gawain appeared to him.

"I have come to warn you of your death," said the Gawain of Arthur's 
dream. "If ye fight with Mordred as ye both have assigned, doubt not 
that ye will be slain. But within the month, Sir Lancelot and all 
his noble knights will come to England to your rescue." 

When Arthur woke, he called his two most trusted knights remaining, 
Sir Bedevere and Sir Lucan, and charged them to make a truce with 
with Mordred. After some hours it was agreed, and the two leaders 
arranged to affirm the treaty betwixt their armies on Salisbury 
Field, and each should bring just fourteen knights. 

Arthur and Mordred met, and were agreed. But it chanced that an 
adder s ancient walls part clad in glossy ivy. ]

and throw it into yonder lake."

Bedevere took the jewelled sword and went down to the lakeside, but 
he hid it behind a tree. "I have done as you ask," he told Arthur. 

"What saw thou at the lake?" asked Arthur. "Sire," replied Bedevere, 
"I saw nothing but waves and the wind on the water." 

"Then thou art lying," said Arthur heavily. "Go again, and quickly, 
for thy tarrying puts my life in jeopardtten that we are doomed should you attain the hermitage". 
He raise his hands in supplication, then disappeared. ]

%Right well had Lancelot done to press on, for it was 
not the hermit's followers, but fiends in their images, which had sought 
to turn Lancelot aside from  and keened greatly. 
Bedevere placed the weakened king into the barge, where the ladies 
received him with great mourning. 

Arthur struggled to speak. "Bedevere, I must go into the vale of 
Avalon to be healed of this wound." And Bedevere watched the barge 
as it sailed away.



Epilogue 
-------- 

When Queen Guenever heard that Arthur was slain, and of the 
bloodshed on Salisbury Field, she stole away quietly to a nunnery at 
Almesbury, and spent the rest of her days in penance for her sins.

As Gawain had prophesied in Arthur's vision, Lancelot landed at 
Dover within a month, having heard of Mordred's treachery.

He was too late to save Arthur, but was determined to see his lady 
Guenever again. For seven days he was on the road and on the eighth 
he came to a nunnery. As he entered the cloister, a nun dressed all 
in black and white saw him there and swooned.

They spoke together for a short time, and when Lancelot saw that 
Guenever had taken to a life of penance, he decided h, 
and between them they bore Sir Ector, bound naked to his 
mount. And they flogged his body with sharp thorns that 
tore his flesh. For certain, there would be little time 
to rescue both, but should he turn first in aid of the innocent 
maiden or of his own brother? ] ; ** CLUE 8 ** ; ** CLUE 9 **

TRIPLE-FORMAT DISCS (AS USED FOR LANCELOT)
------------------------------------------

    The increasing variety of home micros, and the tendency of 
publishers to bring out many individual versions of each game for 
them, poses problems for retailers and players alike. 

Basically, it is difficult for any shop to stock all the machine 
versions of even the more popular games.

    Traditional dual-format discs, whether flippies or otherwise, 
have in effect one version of the game on side A and the other on B. 
This is obviously wasteful of space, as both copies of the game have 
to fit on one disc. 

    Level 9's triple-format discs are different, with just one copy 
of the game, filling most of the disc. There is a small amount of 
machine-specific code to handle things which differ, like disc 
access and picture display.

quests which earned him the title of "Best Knight in the Land"; his 
doomed affairs with Elaine and Guenever, and his success in the quest 
for the Holy Grail.

  to do anything that the player can (e.g Galahad, go to well, fill 
  chalice and cup, find me and give everything to me). 

  These save time, as other people can go off to complete minor 
  puzzles, while you simultaneously tackle something more demanding. 

  The features permit more realistic people in the game and allow a 
  unique range of "multi-player" puzzles which require co-operation 
  to solve. For example, to free Sir Turquin's prisoners quickly, 
  Lancelot commands someone to wind him down in a cage, wait for a 
  signal and wind the cage back up. Then, once down in the prison, 
  Lancelot gets the first escapees to help free the rest.

    Pete Austin has put months of research into the design of a game 
whose language retains the flavour of the original stories, where 
people and events come straight from the legends, and which has a 
mix of traditional adventure puzzles and those concerned with chivalry.
