; MESSAGE.TXT, messages/keywords for the game. 
; 
; ST version 
; 
; Messages are of the form: [ number : text ] ; comment 
; They must be in numeric order, but gaps are allowed in the number 
; sequence, of course. 
; 
; | (vertical bar) terminates the printable part of a message. It 
;   is typed by shifting backslash (to the left of the keyboard). 
; / forces the following character to be printed literally. 
; % is carriage return. Note that carriage return is ignored if 
;   the printing is already at the start of a line, to make coding 
;   simpler. To force a real carriage return, print space first. 
; ^ (shift 6) marks a word for recognition by the parser. It is 
;   followed by a letter for word type: 
;   Adjective; Comment; conJunction; Noun; Preposition; Verb. 
; 
; Capitalization is done automatically on output and you are 
; recommended to use lower case for the first letter of messages 
; as this improves compression and will make no difference on 
; output, providing all punctuation is correct.

Lancelot was warned he would lose honour for leaving the room, which 
contained only a bed, a door back to the castle and an unopenable 
panel in the wall. Lancelot fell asleep whenever he lay on the bed,

opening each time (though a force stopped Lancelot going through it)

following him could get in but, because Breunis moved late in the 
turn sequence, someone waiting for him outside the castle could rush
in and reopen the door from inside. Then Launcelot entered, made 
short work of Breunis, and freed his captive ladies and knights. 

The forest maze was difficult to map, but this was - of course - not 
necessary as Launcelot could get to the centre by following Breunis 
to the Wailing Castle. *

* LOGRIS 

Castle Chariot was the fortress of the witch-queen, Morgan le Fay, 
and stood in a dense forest. The only path was blocked by briars, 
which grew so fast that one person alone could make no progress in 
hacking them down; with two chopping away, the main stem was 
eventually revealed and severed. 

Once past here, Lancelot reached the castle, which stood beside a 
clearing with an apple tree. On first arriving here, Lancelot fell

yet it was so full of strength and nobility that it was ever a 
welcome sight. He was a large man and bore his heavy armour 
with an easy grace] ; Lancelot 
; 
[602:a fair-faced and richly dressed young fellow. Though 
valorous in combat and not without skill in the joust, yet he did 
prefer the pleasures of the court. His skill upon the harp 
was renowned throughout the land] ; Tristram 
; 
[603:a handsome and well-set young knight, but with an air that

nonetheless] ; Sir Bors de Ganis 
; 
[605:a cantankerous old fellow, bluff and hearty] ; Sir Pedivere

and flashing eyes betokened a hot temper. He was deeply loyal 
to his friends, but unforgiving to those who did him 
wrong] ; Sir Gawain 
; 
[607:wearing a surcoat of red. Red too were his shield and the 
plumes on his helm and, had his helm been removed, then could you

above his men] ; the Red Knight 
;

; 
[612:a knight of towering strength and proud demeanour who held 
himself aloof from his fellows] ; Sir Aliduke 
 ; 
[613:a lop-sided man, with a broken nose and a tic by one eye. 
Whether from fleas or from habit, he was ever scratching 
himself] ; Sir Brandiles 
; 
[614:a huge man, with legs like tree trunks. His heavy face was 
framed by a thick thatch of hair and a long unkempt beard] 
; Sir Brian 
; 
[615:brother to Sir Gawain, with the same flaming hair and hot 
temper] ; Sir Geheris 
; 
[616:the youngest of the Orkney clan and quite unlike his

delicate hands] ; Sir Gareth 
; 
[617:the young nephew of Lancelot; a nervous youth, whose 
fingernails were bitten to the quick] ; Sir Lionel

; 
[639:an overstuffed official, striding about like a mountain of 
flesh as he did his job] ; town crier ** CLUE 7 ** 
;
[652:a motley lot. Their hands and faces were exposed to the 
grime of the farmyard, and a strong smell of the stables hung 
about them. Some muttered to each other, while others just 
stared into the distance] ; peasants ** CLUE 1 ** 
; 
[653:gathered to watch the execution. A dirty, ill-dressed mob, 
they waited with malicious pleasure to see the downfall of one 
nobly-born. Though cowed into surly silence, there was yet some 
noise as people scuffled for the best positions] ; crowd

though they took great pride in their grooming] ; hawks above

; 
[656:a daunting sight, in gleaming black armour. He glowering 
down from the heights of his jet-black mount] 
; Black Knight (Arthur in disguise). 
; 
[657:the wife of Arthur. She was tall and beautiful in a cold, 
high-bred manner, with the air of one who would not suffer fools

sorcery. Merlin's long, tangled beard was mottled with many

Escaping after his affair with Guenever, Lancelot returned for the 
service at Pentecost, the arrival and knighting of Galahad and the 
following feast when the Round Table was complete for the first and 
only time. A damosel arrived from Nacien, revealing that Lancelot 
was no longer the best knight. Then the Holy Grail appeared in a 
vision; Gawain swore to see it again - and many other knights did 
likewise; the host paraded through the streets of Camelot and left

    A pavilion stood beside the road, and a damosel emerged to invite 
him inside. She wept if he refused (lack of charity, V3). On entry,

furnished for the court of a king, and the high ceilings and

Then this road led to a White Abbey. On a tomb was written that only 
the best knight in the world should open it. Lancelot lost merit for 
doing so. A foul fiend emerged; too powerful to kill in combat 
(Lancelot died if he tried this), but which fled if Galahad atacked 
(he was "protected by too many angels" for its power). Once the fiend 
had fled, the body of a false Christian man was revealed; Lancelot 
removed it and accepted the monks' offer to bury it elsewhere. A 
shield (made by Joseph of Arimithea and marked with a red cross of 
blood) stood in the main hall. Again, this was for the best knight 
and could only be carried by Galahad. 

The final road led to a forest, where Lancelot simultaneously came 
upon his brother, Sir Ector, who was naked and beaten by two knights, 
being transported one way, while a fair gentlewoman was being abducted 
in the opposite direction. Had he gone after Ector, the gentlewoman 
would have been abused and her kidnapper sable, airy room]

                               SCORING 
                               ------- 

Scoring was in terms of honour, with bonusses for such things as 
rescuing knights or leading Elaine from her kettle, and penalties for 
striking from ambush (e.g the sleeping giant on Servage) and killing 
opponents who had already yielded.

The score was in the range -1000 to +1000 (0 to 2000 internally?), 
with the game being stopped if persistent deeds of infamy caused the 
lower limit to be reached. 

In addition, Lancelot's name was temporarily modified by each scoring 
event; losing the "Sir" from "Sir Lancelot" and adding a suffix, e.g 
"Lancelot the Dragon-slayer" or "Lancelot of Servage". 

To add atmosphere, if any follower(s) of Lancelot were present at an

^N gold ^N glow to the room, making it seem welcoming despite its

[1252:. ^N Piles of ^N rubbish littered the ground, while 
^N soldiers and ^N servant ^N lads scurried to and 
fro. A few mangy ^N dogs and ^N cats searched among the 
^N debris for ^N scraps of ^N food] ; 152 Inside Serf's Gate 
; 
[1253:. ^N Statues of ^N saints lined the walls, and 
^N Lancelot found that his every ^N footst
which would have proved fatal to anyone else, but where Lancelot had 
a last chance to "jump back". A neat example was the "see-saw trap", 
where people must use two exits simultaneously, to balance the floors 
of two passages beyond. E.g, one way of getting it wrong was:
Lancelot was at the junction, with identical doors to northeast and 
northwest. He could see Sir Fallguy. 
SIR FALLGUY, WAIT THEN GO NORTHWEST
Sir Fallguy nodded. 
NE
Lancelot went northeast and was in the east passage. 
The floor wobbled alarmingly! Did Lancelot jump back? YES
Phew! That was close. Lancelot was back at the junction. 
Lancelot heard a cry from the northwest, and what sounded like a 
falling body.

In this case, had Lancelot not jumped back, all would have been 
well. The reason for the example was to demonstrate that the option 
to jump back was not in the movement code, but in special case code 
after movement had taken place. It was probably a good idea to put 
it in the same code as detected the danger to Lancelot and which 
might well have gone on to kill him. 
 
                            LANCELOT ALONE 
                            -------------- 

Several sections of the game (e.g in Castles Chariot and Corbin) were 
basically solved by Lancelot acting alone. For example, he might have 
been taken prisoner and have to escape. In these cases, Lancelot's 
followers (if any) were either captured in another cell, or simply 
left to their own devices until he returned; obeying any orders that hes hung over the ^N track, which was

[2493:knighted Lancelot, and bade him stay and dine with them. 
As they sat at table and the drinks flowed, Lancelot stole many 
a glance at Queen Guenever. Truly, he thought, she was a most 
beautiful and stately woman. And as the evening wore on, it came 
to him that he was fast losing his heart to her. 
%At times, their eyes met and Guenever did look away coyly, 
like a maiden. At length, with his heart in his mouth, he 
essayed to beg of her the favour of being her champion. As 
he had feared, she refused for that she should not be 
championed by a novice, and for a dreadful moment Lancelot 
thought she would rebuff him entirely. 
%But then Guenever smiled knowingly at him and bade him to 
return to her when he had proved himself to be worthy of her 
favour. At this, Lancelot was drunken with pride and joy, 
and swore he would not fail, but would go to Logris without 
delay, there to honour Guenever with noble deeds and battles 
chivalrously won. 
%Sithen Arthur looked upon Lancelot and said, "There are sieges 
yet to be filled at this Round Table, and knights of which I 
have heard - all honourable fellows, the which I need - who 
are held captive by rebel lords who live beyond my rule. Now, 
could you but bring them to Camelot as free men, that would

One Christmas, Merlin advised the Archbishop of Canterbury to invite 
all the "gentlemen of arms" to London: a miracle would reveal the 
rightful king. Against the high alter, in the churchyard, appeared a
marble block and a steel anvil on top; piercing them was a sword 
enscribed, "Whosoever pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil 
is rightwise king born of all England"de himself known as King Arthur, and 
chastised Lancelot sorely for his lack of chivalry. The royal

for his weapons in the dirt]

herself up to her full height, and insisted that Lancelot should 
spare him. As it was late, Guenever made it known that she would 
spend the night at Meliagaunt's castle. But she made it clear 
that Lancelot would be on hand to protect her and that her 
knights would sleep outside her door.

the Queen's honour. Sir Meliagaunt curled his lip at the young 
knight and accepted the challenge, setting the time for three

fight only when Lancelot offered to take off half his armour and

did come to fight. 
%"This will take but a moment!" called 
Meliagaunt, and so it did. For Lancelot taunted Meliagaunt with 
his naked side, and when the other did lunge at him, Lancelot 
stepped apace and with one mighty blow, clove Meliagaunt in two, 
even down to his breastbone.

anxiety passed across his face as he spoke, and did not leave him 
afterwards]

% %Full twenty years passed thuswise, until a prophecy appeared 
above the onest Arthur.

Arthur held a Parliament at York, took advice, decided he had a claim 
to be emperor of Rome himself, and sent the messenger away with gifts 
and the same ultimatum in reverse. Lucius gathered a huge army 
and marched through Arthur's lands in France.

Arthur set sail with his army from Sandwich, leaving Baudwin and 
Constantine in charge. On the night before they landed at Barflete in 
Flanders, Arthur dreamed of a dragon from the west defeating a boar 
from the east.

Arthur learned of a Giant who lived on St Michael's Mount and ate lots 
of people. He fought the Giant and slew him in spectacular fashion.

Arthur learned of the destruction caused by Lucius in Burgundy and sent 
Gawain, Bors, Lionel and Bedevere to tell him to leave - or, if Lucius 
would not, to bid him fight Arthur and not the common people. Lucius 
challenged Arthur in return.

Sir Gainus, cousin to the emperor, accused the Britons of boasting, so 
Gawain slew him. They escaped, followed by the Roman knighope to defeat a group of knights with neither sword nor armour]

with a great army previously held in reserve. Arthur took up the 
surrounding towns and dispersed parties to block any Roman escapers; 
then joined battle in the vale of Sessoine. Arthur slew Lucius in 
individual combat, and a hundred thousand Romans and Saracens were 
killed. He sent three surviving Senators back to Rome with the noble 
Roman bodies; they advised the Protestate and Senate to make Peace.

Arthur consolidated France. While beseiging a stubborn city in Tuscany,

head and setting it back on the knight's body.

Much the same thing happened ten days later, except that Gareth diced 
the knight's head into tiny pieces, and the fight reopened his wounds.
Lynet annointed the gobbets and set them together again, but Gareth 
could only be cured by he who caused the wound, and Lynet denied all.

Meanwhile at Pentecost, the Green, Red and Blue Knight (Pertolepe) 
arrived at court and yielded to King Arthur, praising Beaumains. And 
the Red Knight of the Red Launds, Sir Ironside, did likewise and was 
made a knight of the Round Table. 

Then Queen Morgause of Orkney, Arthur's sister, arrived to find what 
had happened to Gareth. She was not pleased to learn of Sir Kay's 
taunts, but was happy that Gareth seemed to have done well. Arthur 
sent a messenger, summoning Dame Lyonesse to tell all.

Dame Lyonesse consulted with Gareth and Gringamore. She was to say she 
knew not where Gareth was, but was to arrange a tournament with her 
lands as the prize. This she did, then returned. Gareth could not take 
part unless he was healed, so Lynet was induced to cure him.

The tournament went on for many pages, with Sir Gareth disguised first 
in many colours, then in yellow. He was beating everyone in the mele, 
but escaped when recognised.
