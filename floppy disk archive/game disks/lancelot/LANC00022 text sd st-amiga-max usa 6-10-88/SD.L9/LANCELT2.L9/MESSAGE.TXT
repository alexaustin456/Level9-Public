Dinadan met Tristram and they argued about whether lovers made good 
knights. Tristram refused to give his name, so Dinadan became angry 
and called him a coward. Then Sir Epinogrus, great lover of the King 
of Wales' daughter, arrived. Dinadan jousted with him to prove the 
point but was knocked down.

thought it was fired by Palomides. 

On the day set for battle, Sir Palomides arrived on the appointed 
field, bringing witnesses from Arthur's court. But Tristram sent a 
message that he was injured, though he would pursue Palomides once 
cured.

fairest lady in the world, apart from Guenever. 

They gave thanks in a chapel. The people also gave thanks and told

[604:a stolid, reliable knight, and one of the longest-standing 
of the company of the Round Table. Sir Bors he message that he would not return until proved more worthy than the 
likes of Kay and Mordred who had mocked him. 

Percival met a knight with a broken shield and broken helm; they 
jousted and Percival was smitten down. They fought on foot for half a 
day, Percival's strength being matched by the other's experience. Then 
the other knight, Sir Ector, knew he was dying of his wounds, and asked 
Percival to ride for a priest. But Percival was too weak to ride.

scahe knight of the pavilion armed himself, hoping to disarm Launcelot 
by force, but Launcelot struck him a near-fatal blow on the head, 
rushed into the bed in the pavilion - disturbing the lady who was 
there.

The dwarf recognised Launcelot and the knight, Sir Bliant, and his 
brother, Sir Selivant, carried the bed containing Launcelot to Castle 
Blank. Launcelot was well looked after for a year and a half, but they 
kept him tied up as he did not recover his wits. 

Then the lord of the that castle, Sir Bliant, was riding in a forest 
when Breunis Saunce Pite and his brother, Sir Bertelot, attacked him 
simultaneously. Blaint fought them both well, but was wounded and fled 
back towards his castle. Launcelot broke his chains, ran out at a 
postern, pulled down Sir Bertelot with his bare hands and used 
Bertelot's sword to knock down Sir Breunis. Sir Bertelot tried to run 
Launcelot through, but Blaint struck off his hand & the brothers fled.

Lancelot's eyes that looked upon him] ; magic knight in Perilous

betrayed little of what he thought. Yet was he agile and fast,  
an, where Elaine lived 
with Galahad, their son. The young men through turves at Launcelot, 
and he threw down any he could reach, breaking their limbs, and ran 
into the castle. The knights and squires recognised him for a man of 
worship and gave him food and clothing. 

Sir Pelles' nephew, Castor, was made knight at Candlemas and they sent 
for a fool. Castor gave Launcelot a robe of scarlet and, when he was 
arrayed like a knight, he was the seemliest man in the court. Elaine 
and her maidens found Launcelot sleeping in the garden, and she 
recognised him but said nothing. 

King Pelles, Elaine, Dame Brisen and four trusted men took Launcelot 
secretly to the chamber where was the Holy Grail, and it cured him.

Launcelot was ashamed of his madness, but Dame Elaine explained that 
nobody else knew. Launcelot rested for a fortnight, then apologised 
to Elaine for threatening to kill her after their first meeting, then 
announced his intention to stay and not return to Arthur's court.

Sir Percival and Launcelot fought for two hours, wounding each other 
sore, then paused to talk. When Launcelot learned his opponent's name, 
he was sorry for fighting a Round Table knight, gave own true name 
and told the whole story to Percival and Ector de Maris. 

Launcelot heard how he was missed at Arthur's court and decided to 
return, taking his son Galahad to be knighted. And thein Castle Chariot.

Tristram eventually knocked Palomides' sword from his hand, but refused 
to take advantage of this. Palomides did not want to fight any more, 
offered peace between them and was confessed and babtised. 

They went to the feast at Camelot, then Tristram returned to Joyous 
Gard and Palomides followed the Questing Beast.

to a cross, where he slept and dreamed of a gold-crowned king, with a 
fellowship of seven kings and two knights, all of whom worshipped at 
the cross. An old man seemed to descend from Heaven, with a company of 
angels, and blessed them and called him his servants, good and true 
knights. But he had lost all he had set in one knight, who ruled 
himself as a warrior in wrong wars, for vain glory and the pleasure 
of the world.

Launcelot. She said Launcelot was the best earthly knight; one party 
represented earthly knights, clothed in their black sins; the other

Bors' dreams: the white bird was a lady who loved him and would die if 
rejected, and Launcelot would die if Bors warned the lady, much as 
Lionel had already done. Bors was led to a high tower, given fine

She told how Pelles, the Maimed King, found the ship and drew the

him down. Unable to move, he felt himself carried from the chamber. 

The people of the castle found Launcelot next day, and took care of 
him for twenty-four days, until he awoke. (This was a penance for the 
twenty-four years that he had been a sinner.) Launcelot was well, but 
weak, and asked where he was: the people said the castle of Carbonek. 

Launcelot spoke with King Pelles and was sad to learn that Elaine was 
dead. He stayed for four days and then prepared to leave. But suddenly 
all the doors and windows slammed shut; then a knight knocked at the 
front door and demanded entrance. The king refused him entrance while 
the Grail was in the castle, but when the knight gave his name as Sir

Sir Bors was very sad he had wounded him, but Queen Guenever thought

hermit of Windsor Forest, and stayed there - Launcelot spending his 
days beside a fountain. As he lay there, a huntress overshot her 
target and struck him in the buttock, and this wound took a long time 
to heal and troubled Launcelot as he could not sit in the saddle. 

However, Launcelot was just able to attend the next tournament; both 
he and Lavaine being dressed as Saracens. He fought against Arthur's 
party, and the tournament wennd cried,  
"O Lancelot, flower of chivalry, now have I found thee".%He 
caught his breath and spoke on, "I bring news from King Mark of 
Cornwall, besieged in Tintagel. The Sessoine host have landed  
from their ships and lie in siege about the city. My lord bade me 
ride through their army and to bring King Arthur's knights to our 
aid. Prithee come with all speed!"

but when he came to the place of the battle, he met thirty archers 
left by Meliagaunt. They told Launcelot to turn back and, when he 
refused, smote his horse with many arrows.

him around for seven years in a horse litter, seeking a cure, until 
they came to Arthur's court, which was then at Carlisle. Everyone 
tried to cure Urre and failed. Then Launcelot prayed and succeeded.

were made knights of the Round Table.

that he met Sir Gawain, surrounded by the fair ladies he had fought 
for and by whose grace he had returned. Gawain said that Arthur should 
not fight tomorrow, but delay for a month. 

Arthur told the dream to his knights, and made a treaty with Mordred.

him a ring, like that worn by Guenever, and said that the Queen 
was waiting for him. And Lancelot weened that maiden Elaine had 
been Queen Guenever and he took her in his arms. 
%When they had lain together, Lancelot remembered himself and 
left. But his anger and guilt did not last, because it was not 
by his intent that he was unfaithful to Guenever. And Lancelot

his efforts]

DESCIPTION OF RATING 
--------------------

Though Lancelot's rank did not change with his score, he started 
as a squire, was knighted by Arthur and finally was made a Knight 
of the Round Table. Also, as is detailed elsewhere, a suffix was 
added to Lancelot's name for a little time after each embarassing 
event. ing in

untrue to Guenever]

heart, for this was a love potion. Under its enchantment, he 
betrayed Guenever and cried out for Queen Morgan. She smirked in

we still have to package the "small machine" version of the system 
(it's working, I think, but not finalised) and, of course, check the 
game on a great variety of hardware. 

           We all looked at the Grail sketch yesterday, and called 
upon the opinion of a couple of unbiased visitors. Briefly... 

We obtained rare unanimity in the opinion that, briefly, the 
ornamentation was good, but the overall shape of the chalice looked 
wrong. It's too spindly. 

If its height was squashed to less than half the current proportion, 
and (additionally) the bowl increased significantly in size relative 
to the stem, then you'd have more the right effect. 

I would personally go for slightly less complex ornamentation, with 
perhaps a "frosted" ring around the body of the bowl to emphasise 
its apparent weight. 

                         Best wishes,

towards favouring presentation over content continued; and the year 
ended with Activision making the baffling decision to withdraw most of
