PUZZLES

In order to capitalise on the full facilities of Level 9's adventure 
system, it is necessary to take care when designing multi-player 
puzzles. Puzzles which can be solved sequentially (e.g a NPC goes and 
does something while the player has no involvement in the task), are 
undesirable as they can be emulated on simpler adventure systems. 

It is important to ensure that multi-player puzzles are genuine; i.e 
that several characters are actively involved, at the same time. 

Categories are:

1) Too much for one person to do (e.g boat: one rows, one bails).

2) Co-ordination (e.g catapult up acrobat to grab high object).

3) Two places at once (e.g sound alarm to decoy guard from vault).
