            LAUNCELOT THINGS. COPYRIGHT (C) 1988 LEVEL 9 
            --------------------------------------------
 
The game was made up of three adventure programs, corresponding to 
Camelot, Logris (England) and the Grail Lands. The player could 
transfer at will between the first two of these, but the final Grail 
Lands part was completely seperate. 

It was assumed (as would be explained in the book) that all relevant 
people had horses, weapons etc at need; it would have been tedious 
to force the player to handle them explicitely. Horses, for example, 
were only mentioned as part of the text for movement: when travelling 
outside on land, people were described as riding; when going from 
outside to inside, they "dismounted" first, and when first moving 
about outside, having been dismounted, they mounted. Likewise, weapons 
and armour are mentioned in the text for combat. 

Examinining someone described their armour and any horse etc. 

Linkage. The idea was to play the parts in order, but they could be 
treated much as separate games. Part 3 was self-contained (intended 
to be played after the others; the only thing carried across being 
Lancelot's score), but the other two were completely linked and L. 
could pass between them at will. Thus it was important that object 
numbers did not conflict in the two parts (so that Lancelot found 
things where he had left them on returning to a part), and that 
portable objects and recruitable people were duplicated. Thus, L. 
could lead his freed knights to Arthur, if he wished, and see their 
reunion. (Obviously, however, it was not essential to duplicate all 
special properties: the Horn direction was only needed in Part 2 
for example).
