Dear Neil, 

          Thanks for the latest batch of pictures. I've assessed the 
final versions, with the following comments:

* Pictures 28 and 29 will need amending when the grail is designed. 
(Believe it or not, Database still haven't come up with a final 
version!) 

* Picture 30 (the loading screen) will be needed at this time. 

                 -----------------------------

* Picture 16 is a good tower, but the arched windows are wrong for 
it. Please replace all the windows with cross ones (like the 
existing cross windows but perhaps twice as big). There should only 
be a few windows, perhaps 6, all in the top half of the tower. 

* Pictures 2 and 22 look wrong. The random bright pixels used to 
represent flowers don't work for me. (Though I like e.g 1 and 20). 

* Picture 3 is generally fuzzy and lacks detail. 

* Database would like changes to the following pictures.. 
  21: the cross to look more "solid"; 
  23: the ships to look more realistic (e.g like Viking ships..  
      they are currently too tall and very high in the water); 
  25: something to break the symmetry, e.g a distant isle; 
  27: the picture to look more "dramatic". 

          Could you look at the pictures, and let me have the 
results ASAP. 

                      Many thanks, 


                                  Pete Austin
