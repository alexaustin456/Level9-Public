Dear Mike, 

          Here are suggested revisions for your two press releases. 

A version of (1), without the final paragraph, has been posted to 
Rainbird. (However, I'm withholding agreement to publish from them 
until we get the form of the seperation agreement, which was been 
verbally agreed ages ago, confirmed in writing.) I had to pass the 
news on, in order that they got the details not later than, I guess, 
magazines will. 
 
I'm uncertain about three aspects of (2).
a) The "one million budget" idea doesn't seem entirely credible and is 
   only mentioned at the top in any case.
b) If price is mentioned, it must be right. It might be necessary to 
   omit this, unless someone can work out costings fairly quickly. 
c) The release seems a bit long.. but maybe this is inevitable, and I 
   would defer to your judgement in any case. 

I look forward to seeing the final versions. 

                           Best wishes, 
 


                                       Pete Austin.

Rainbird Software and Level 9 part company

  Rainbird Software and Level 9 are to part company, after the latter's 
decision to join a new publishing venture. 

  Future Level 9 titles will be released by Mandarin, a company set up 
by the international Europress Group, the parent company of Database 
Publications. 

  "I wish them every success", said Paul Hibbard, Publisher of 
Rainbird Software, explaining that the parting was mutually agreed. 

  One immediate effect is that the Time & Magik adventure trilogy, due 
to go out under the Rainbird label, will now be published by Mandarin. 

  "We would like to thank Rainbird for doing a good job of marketing 
Jewels of Darkness, Silicon Dreams and Knight Orc. However, we felt 
the time was right for us to move on", says Pete Austin of Level 9.

  "The marketing knowledge and publishing skills of Mandarin will 
reinforce Level 9's position as the leading UK adventure house, and 
their understanding of production needs should allow us to bring out 
one or two more games this year than last."

Million Pound Budget for New Label to provide Exclusive Games 

  Mandarin is a new top-end label, combining the marketing muscle of 
The Europress Group, parent company of Database Publications, the 
renowned programming skills of Level 9, and a budget of œ1 million. 

  The first package to be released by Mandarin will be Time & Magik, an 
adventure trilogy from Level 9.
  Time & Magik contains three of the adventure games house's best games, 
Lords of Time, Red Moon and Price of Magik. These classic games - with 
a dozen "adventure of the year" awards between them - have now been 
substantially enhanced and are available on a wider range of micros, 
to ensure the collection becomes a bestseller in its own right. 
  Time & Magik offers up to 60,000 words of text (more than an average 
paperback), with a correspondingly enlarged vocabulary, 700 locations 
and high-quality pictures in disk versions. 
  The packaging is the best ever for any Level 9 game, with a detailed 
play-guide and short story to accompany the game. 
  Level 9 will provide their usual unrivalled help service; sending a 
bundle of cluesheets, with a total of 1600 entries, free to any buyer 
who gets stuck. 

  Time & Magik will be released on March 16, at between œ14.95 (8-bit) 
and œ24.95 (16-bit), for almost everything. The full list of versions 
available at this time is: Amiga disk, IBM PC disk, ST disk, Mac disk, 
Amstrad CPC/PCW disk and CPC tape, Apple II disk, Atari XL/XE tape and 
disk, Commodore 64 tape and disk, MSX tape and Spectrum tape. 
  "We think that Level 9's programming, combined with Mandarin's 
knowledge of the marketplace, their abilities in printing and 
packaging and their understanding of the need to get products out 
on time, will be an unbeatable combination", 
said Pete Austin of Level 9.

  Mandarin's involvement with the adventure games software house will 
be the first of a series of joint ventures. 
  "We have the fortunate combination of great financial muscle and low 
overheads", said Chris Payne, spokesman for the new venture. "We could 
not be more sound financially and we don't have to rush out titles to 
maintain cash flow, so we are in a superb position to pick and choose 
not only our partners, but also just what products we intend to release 
and when. 
  "It is our aim that the Mandarin label will become synonymous with 
quality, providing the Rolls-Royce of games software. 
  "And what better way to start than with Level 9?"
