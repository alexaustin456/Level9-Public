Dear Chris, 

           Level 9's current plans for BBC versions are as follows, 
taking Time and Magik as an example.. 

BBC Time and Magik will be supplied on one 80-track, flippy disc, 
(though owners of double-sided drives will be able to copy the game 
onto a conventional double-sided disc if they wish). 


   It will not work on standard BBC Bs, but should work almost every 
kind of BBC master, B+ or expanded BBC B. It's the same disk for all 
these varieties of BBC, but larger machines provide more facilities..

BBC Master: game with graphics; the pictures can be scrolled up down 
(as on other disk micros) and the effect when pictures load is as on 
the demo disk (the old picture scrolls off, the disk whirrs, and the 
new picture scrolls down). 

BBC B+, or BBC B with Shadow RAM & Sideways RAM: game with graphics; 
the picture area is static and each picture is simply blacked out 
when a new picture loads. 

BBC B with Shadow RAM or Sideways RAM (see above for both): text-only 
game without pictures. 

(Master Compact: as BBC Master, but the game would have to be 
supplied on a different, 3" disk, which may not be justified.) 


   Hardware. Most (or all?) types of sideways RAM are suitable, but 
shadow RAM poses more of a problem as the various shadow RAM boards 
differ significantly. We will certainly support the two most common 
types (I believe them to be the "Watford 32K Shadow RAM Expansion 
Board" and "Aries Shadow RAM" boards). 

No firm promises on the above (it's always possible that we'll hit 
unforseen snags), but you'd be fairly safe to pass on the details.
