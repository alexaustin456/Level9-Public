Dear Joan, 

          Thanks for doing the Lancelot graphics, which will be on 
display when the game is launched at this year's PC (nee PCW) show. 

I have copies of the following pictures: 1-15,23,24,26,28 and 29, 
which makes twenty. 

At our usual rate of 50 pounds per picture, this means that we owe 
you a round 1,000 pounds. Please could you contact John to arrange 
payment (I expect he will want an invoice). 

                          Thanks again, 


                                       Pete Austin


PS: I knew you wanted a break, and have arranged other artists for 
Gnome II. If you want to do some more pictures in future, however, 
by all means let us know.
