Dear Christina, 

               It's Lancelot game text time. The adventure is being
playtested, so we need the final version of the text.  

I enclose the following: 
* Amiga disc of the adventure, so you can see how the current text 
  messages link together. 
* Listing of the current text messages. 
* Annotated photocopy of map, to show room numbers. 
* Disc of the text. 

The idea is to enlarge the text, make sure it is "in character", and 
add interesting descriptions, conversation, comments on Life etc, 
where appropriate. 



Mainly, this will involve the following groups of messages (numbers 
are those of part 1 and may differ slightly): 

(600-799) "Examine messages", printed when Lancelot looks at things. 
          These can be as big as you like. 

(800-920 & 940-1099) "Short room descriptions". Keep concise. 

(930-939) "Echo locations", printed on entry to an interesting dead- 
           end. Enlarge quite a bit. 

(1350-1599) Messages printed on first entering locations. This section 
            is suited to transient events (e.g peasant kids throwing 
            a turnip at Lancelot and running away) and one-off 
            comments which would be wearisome if repeated whenever 
            Lancelot returned to a location (e.g "Lancelot was 
            surprised to see how young the King looked). 

(1100-1349) "Long room descriptions", which are appended to the short 
            ones. Not every room should have a long description, but 
            all rooms near the start of the game, and all interesting 
            rooms, should have. You will probably add more text to 
            this section than any other. 

(Elsewhere) You will find many groups of alternative messages, e.g 
            3100-3104,3110-3114,3270-3274 etc. These groups tend to 
            be aligned at every 10th number. 

            Please enlarge the groups to contain 10 messages each in 
            parts 1 and 3 (e.g 3100-3109), and 5 messages each in 
            part 2 (which is somewhat bigger). And add a lot more 
            variety to the alternative texts (at present, some groups 
            have little variation, and some are all identical). 

In addition, there are a lot of one-off messages scattered about. 
Please improve them, where you can do so with reasonable safety. 



Notes:
* When altering text, please retain the existing punctuation at start 
  and end, so that messages still link together properly. 
* In location descriptions and long location descriptions, please add 
  "^N " before all nouns. 
* Note that ";" is the comment symbol - don't waste time on messages 
  prefaced by this. 
* A rough idea of size is that you should almost double the size of 
  the text in parts 1 and 3 (I mean that in the square brackets; all 
  the rest of the file is comments) and add about 50% to part 2. 

Please 'phone if you have questions, and I recommend that you send 
part 1 before the others, for us to check. 

                            Best wishes, 


                                        Pete Austin.
