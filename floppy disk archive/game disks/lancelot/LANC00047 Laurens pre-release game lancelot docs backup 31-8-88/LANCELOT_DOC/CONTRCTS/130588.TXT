Dear Christina, 

               Thanks for the Arthur story, which Mike and I have 
both now read. Apart from a few individual phrases, which I'll sub- 
edit here, there is only one part that needs a little extra work: 
the first story, which seems somewhat stilted. 

Could you please have another look at the phrasing of "The Birth of 
a King" episode, then send me have a disk of the whole story and an 
invoice so that we can pay you. Thanks. 

               I'm currently play-testing Lancelot, and will send 
you a disk of the initial version of the text next week (probably 
leaving here on Monday), so I recommend that you allow some time 
over the next month for enlarging/polishing/inventing text for the 
game. 

                        Best wishes, 



                                    Pete Austin
