     ;
     ; Messages are of the form: [ number : text ] ; comment
     ; They must be in numeric order, but gaps are allowed in the number
     ; sequence, of course.
     ;
     ; | (vertical bar) terminates the printable part of a message. It
     ;   is typed by shifting backslash (to the left of the keyboard).
     ; / forces the following character to be printed literally.
     ; % is carriage return. Note that carriage return is ignored if
     ;   the printing is already at the start of a line, to make coding
     ;   simpler. To force a real carriage return, print space first.
     ; ^ (shift 6) marks a word for recognition by the parser. It is
     ;   followed by a letter for word type:
     ;   Adjective; Comment; conJunction; Noun; Preposition; Verb.
     ;
     ; Capitalization is done automatically on output and you are
     ; recommended to use lower case for the first letter of messages
     ; as this improves compression and will make no difference on
     ; output, providing all punctuation is correct.
     ;

     ;
     [601:a brave and fearless knight. He had an interesting face, with a
     strong nose and jaw, which gave him a proud and noble expression,
     although he looked older than his years. Of medium height, he was
     stockily built, with broad shoulders. His armour was new and still
     didn't quite look as though it had 'settled' on him.] ; Lancelot.

     [602:Tristram, who had fair silky hair and a slightly foppish manner.
     He was famous throughout the land for his accomplishments on the harp,
     the which you could see borne on his slight shoulders. He was nimble
     and agile in combat, which made up for his lack of brute force] ; Tristram.
     [603:Galahad. The sun seemed to shine all around Galahad, of the
     golden hair, sunny smile and cornflower blue eyes. His debonair,
     carefree manner suggested that little was ever likely to go wrong in Galahad's
     life. His armour gleamed, even on the dullest day, his horse was the
     sleekest and fleetest of them all, he was truly everything a dashing young
     knight should be. And he knew it.  ] ; Galahad.
     [604:Bors de Ganis, a steady and reliable knight whom you could
     usually count on. He was one of the longest-standing of the Round
     Table, and embodied all its values of chivalry and valour] ; Bors de Ganis.
     [605:a knight with a large question mark tattooed on his head, jovial
     and hearty] ; Mark.
     [606:Gawain, small, dark and perpetually scowling. It was difficult to
     examine Gawain for any length of time, for he was always fidgetting,
     itching to be off to do battle, or prove himself on some dangerous
     quest ] ; Gawain.
     [607:a Red Knight. From the top of his curly red hair, to the bottom
     of his rust-coloured legplates, he was entirely dressed in red. Of the
     same colour were all his accountrements, his spear, sword and shield ] ; Red Knight.
     [608:the badly wounded form of Sir Meliot. Lacerated from scalp to
     foot with deep, gaping wounds from spear and sword, it was difficult
     to imagine how he had looked whole] ; Meliot.

     [609:Lamorak, small and wiry, with an aggressive demeanour ] ; Lamorak.

     [610:Ector de Maris, the brother of Lancelot, a faithful, competent
     knight whose love for his brother kept him blindly loyal, and brave in
     his shadow] ; Ector.
     [611:Agravain, brother of Gawain, who had pointed features, and sharp
     ferret-like nose] ; Agravain.
     [612:Aliduke. He was tall and powerful, of burly build, and his armour
     was riddled with nicks and dents from fierce battles ] ; Aliduke.
     [613:Brandiles, who was, as usual, scratching himself. he had a
     crooked face, accentuated by a broken nose.] ; Brandiles.

     . He looked
     and fiddled with his wristlets, chewing at his lower lip the
     meanwhile. His fingernails were bitten down to the quick] ; Lionel.
     [618:Marhaus, who was older than many of the other knights, and bore
     many scars of battles on his face and arms] ; Marhaus.
     [619:a knight of particularly evil appearance, with hooded brows and a






     single straight line where two distinct eyebrows should have been, and
     a gnarled chin which jutted alarmingly from his fac. He looked
     and fiddled with his wristlets, chewing at his lower lip the
     meanwhile. His fingernails were bitten down to the quick] ; Lionel.
     [618:Marhaus, who was older than many of the other knights, and bore
     many scars of battles on his face and arms] ; Marhaus.
     [619:a knight of particularly evil appearance, with hooded brows and a






     single straight line where two distinct eyebrows should have been, and
     a gnarled chin which jutted alarmingly from his face. He had perhaps
     been  spoiled by the many treacherous deeds and battles in his past] ;
     Sir Breunis.

     [620:invisible. Lancelot could hear his pattering feet
     running around, but could see nothing of him] ; Invisible Garlon.
     ;;
     [622:an impressive-looking knight with a shimmering
     aura] ; magic knight in Perilous Bedroom.
     [623:Turquin, hard-faced knight with little expression in his granite-
     like features. Even his eyes seemed glassy and to betray little of
     what he was thinking. His fast agile movements, however, belied a
     quick intelligence and cunning] ; Turquin.
     [624:wearing about half the armour in the kingdom. A full set of half-
     inch mail was merely the outer layer - inside were layers of mail
     and leathers. His horse could obviously hardly cope with the weight -
     and Pedivere was swaying from side to side on top] ; Pedivere.
     [625:the Black Knight. He looked as though he was made out of solid
     stone, so thick were his limbs. His armour shone like ebony  ] ; Black Knight.
     [626:the Green Knight. If anything, he was taller and even more
     powerful than the Black Knight, and the veins stood out starkly on his
     temples and his hands. The green colouring, of his armour and also his
     horse, made it difficult to see him clearly from a distance] ; Green Knight.

     ;
     ;
     [627:the Red Knight, towering above the surroundings on a chestnut horse the
     size of a outhouse. With his flowing flame coloured hair, he looked as
     though his very head was on fire] ; Red Knight.
     [628:Hellawes, a sorceress able to take on many forms. In her natural
     state, she was evidentally not in her first youth, but still carried
     herself rigidly upright, her long stright black hair splashed with
     grey, and piercing jet-coloured eyes that seemed to see straight into
     your mind] ; Hellawes the Witch.
     [629:Queen Morgan. She was a tall, angularly thin woman, with a long
     sharp nose, and dark, dramatically etched features. Her talon-like pointed
     fingernails and long narrow feet accentuated this. Her beauty was cold
     and almost cruel, but always fascinating ] ; Q. Morgan.
     [630:Queen Northgales, tall, blonde and statuesque, with a commanding
     face when it was in repose. However, when she smiled, she blossomed
     and looked almost coy] ; Q. Northgales.
     [631:Queen Eastlands, petite and dark, with impish features and dark eyes
     like deep pools, mysterious and alluring] ; Q. Eastlands.
     [632:Queen Outisles, whose flame-coloured hair belied her reputation
     for a fiery temper when aroused to anger. Her piercing green eyes had
     often, it was said, reduced lesser knights and servants to grovelling
     when she became imperious] ; Q. Outisles.
     [633:furious to be examined like any object. "Prithee keep thy bug
     eyes to thyself", she spat] ; Damosel Maledisant.
     [634:very pretty. She caught Lancelot's gaze and blushed, then
     smiled back, shily but hopefully] ; damosel warder in Castle Chariot.
     [635:very upset by the plight of her master. Her face was swollen with
     crying, and twisted with anguish] ; damosel tending
     ; Meliot.
     ;
     [636:a charming lady who seemed very agitated about something,
     and kept looking from the tree to the castle behind her] ; Lady.
     [637:about 8 feet tall, thickly built and looking immensely
     strong. His legs were as broad as the pillars in the great hall at






     Camelot, and his head looked as though it had been chiselled from
     granite] ; Giant Nabon.
     ;
     [640:a huge army laying siege to Tintagel Castle. their shields
     shimmered in the sunlight, so that they resembled a great river
     flowing through the Cornish valley] ; Sessoine army.
     [641:a wizened old carter, his face gnarled like a walnut, bandy-
     legged and arms on which the veins stood out like knotted cords] ; carter.
     [642:a beautiful young woman
     [646:some kilted sentries, looking sturdy, strong and somewhat dour]
      ; sentries of Orkney Tower.
     [647:about 30 fully-armoured knights, dressed in black. Their armour
     glinted darkly and menacingly, while their visors were all down,
     making it impossible to catch sight of a face among them]
     ; Hellawes' Thirty knights.
     [648:keeping a close eye on Lancelot, and looked determined not
     to let him enter the tower] ; Guard of Orkney Tower.

     ; [649:a fiendly dragon puffing fire and brimstone. Two long teeth,
     pointing inwards could be seen protruding from a cavernous jaw] ; fiendly dragon.
     [650:a remarkably bloated bird. Lancelot was amazed that this bird
     could actually fly. Its lunes were tangled in the foliage of the
     tree] ; hawk, tangled in tree.
     [651:a large dog, standing about waist height to Lancelot. He had a
     lean wiry coat, and a droopy mouth, which salivated slightly. You
     could not help but notice the four huge paws supporting the strong
     legs] ; brachet.

     the condition of the wood at the splintered end] ; broken branch.
     [681:a piece of cloth, a rough neutral-coloured linen] ; cloth.
     [682:delicious-looking. It was a glistening stew, with  chunks of lean
     meat and colourful vegetables nestling in a rich gravy, and smelled
     heavenly] ; tempting food in prison.
     [683:a glass of wine, sparkling in a simple glass] ; glass of wine.
     [684:a small harp. The wood was a little worn, but highly polished,
     and it was tightly strung] ; Tristram's harp.
     [685:a beautifully carved horn. It was not particularly ornate, but
     each etch made in the surface brought out the grain of the bone in
     fine detail] ; signal horn.

     [687:a small metal plate, rather battered, and none too clean] ; prison utensil.

     [693:large, very hot, cauldron] ; cauldron.
     [694:a winch, connected by hidden chains to the cage] ; prison winch.

     [715:some bushes, large enough to hide in] ; bushes.
     [716:a cage, connected by ropes to the winch. It was large enough
     to carry several people between the upper and lower parts
     of the prison] ; prison winch.
     [717:a large cart pulled by a cart-horse. Solid planks were lashed
     together, and the wheels looked strong and evenly positioned] ; cart.
     [718:a strong chest] ; chest.
     [719:a crossbow. Lancelot easily destroyed the evil device with
     a quick blow from his sword, and the broken mechanism disintegrated
     into tiny fragments] ; crossbow trap.
     [720:a fire burning brightly] ; fire.
     [721:a lever apparently connected to something in the room
     below] ; prison lever.
     ; [722:a lid. It was chiselled out of stone and looked extremely heavy] ; lid of tomb.
     [723:a keyhole. Lancelot could see nothing through it, and strangely,
     there seemed to be no lock mechanism inside] ; Nabon's keyhole.
     [724:a panel, which was just slightly out of alignment with those
     adjacent to it] ; secret panel.
     [725:some squeaky planks in the flin invasion fleet, pulled up by the

     reared up out of the water] ; Sessoine ships.
     [731:some shutters across the window] ; Garlon's shutters.

     felt slimy with damp. The heavy ^N air smelt like a stagnant ^N pond]
     [804:in the ^N courtyard, a stone-flagged ^N square. It had evidentally
     been recently weeded, since the ^N soil between the ^N stones was loose and
     newly turned ]
     [805:in a ^N secret ^N passage. It was very dark, and so narrow that
     you would need to squeeze your ^N way through the jagged ^N rock in places.
     The uneven ^N floor needed careful negotiation, although a few rough
     ^N steps had been cut into the ^N ground to cope with sharp ^N descents and
     ^N hills]
     [806:in the ^N entrance, under a wide ^N arch of ^N stone encrusted with
     ^N flints. The embellishment of a human ^N skull nailed to the ^N centre of the
     ^N arch was not a particularly welcoming ^N touch]
     [807:in a ^N gateway. The ^N gates, massive ^N structures of solid wrought
     ^N iron, were flung back]
     [808:in a ^N cell. The ^N ceiling was so low that ^N Lancelot could
     barely stand up straight, and ^N puddles of ^N moisture had collected
     in the ^N dips in the uneven ^N floor]

     [809:in a ^N prison ^N corridor, a narrow winding ^N passageway, which
     led uphill and downwards in disorientating ^N turns]
     [810:in a ^N cell, a long narrow ^N room, with a rough ^N pile of ^N straw in
     one ^N corner. A tiny ^N grille set into the high ^N ceiling let in a little
     ^N light, but nothing could be seen through it, and it was way out of
     reach]
     [812:in a ^N prison, a ^N passageway from which a ^N number of heavy wooden
     ^N doors led into the ^N cells. Every ^N sound echoed around the stone
     ^N chambers. It was so cold that ^N Lancelot could see his
     own ^N breath]
     [813:on ^N deck, standing high above the surging ^N waters below. The
     whole ^N ship creaked in the ^N wind, and some of the ^N planks which made up
     the ^N deck seemed to shake]
     [814:in a ^N castle. The ^N rooms were much higher thano the ^N cells]
     [816:on some ^N stairs, rickety with age and with many ^N steps missing.
     Wooden ^N slats had obviously been placed on the stone ^N ledges at some
     point, but many of these had rotted or worn away]
     [817:in a room with a ^N bath, a small ^N chamber with a roaring ^N fire at
     the far end. ^N Cauldrons of steaming ^N water hung over the ^N fireplace, and






     a number of large ^N towels were placed on a ^N shelf to one side of the
     ^N hearth, warmingo the ^N cells]

     a number of large ^N towels were placed on a ^N shelf to one side of the

     [818:in a ^N hall, a wide ^N room lit by ^N torches in ornate ^N holders fixed
     to the ^N walls. ^N Trophies from ^N hunting and ^N battles hung everywhere, from
     complete ^N suits of ^N armour to stuffed ^N animals' ^N heads]
     [819:on some ^N stairs. The spiral ^N staircase wound tightly around the
     ^N contours of the ^N tower, while the occasional slit ^N windows afforded a
     fine ^N view of the ^N shoreline]
     [820:in the ^N perilous ^N bedroom. It was very dark, but a large ^N bed
     with a plump ^N mattress and a ^N washstand could just be perceived in the
     ^N gloom]
     [821:in the lower branches of the ^N elm, broad and solid and slightly
     mossy. Parting the ^N greenery of the young ^N sprigs revealed the ^N tree
     continuing to stretch upwards to the ^N sky]
     [822:in Elaine's ^N bedroom. A soft golden ^N glow from the flickering
     ^N firelight and numerous ^N candles lit up the huge four poster ^N bed in the middle
     of the ^N room, with its coverings of ^N samite and heavy ^N drapes
     surrounding it. Delicately
     woven ^N tapestries hung over the ^N walls]
     [823:in a ^N chapel beside a ^N tomb, a small squat wooden ^N building, with a
     simple wooden ^N cross above the mossy thatched ^N roof. A few ancient
     ^N relics graced the ^N walls which reached straight up to the shallow
     ^N rafters. The sparsely decorated ^N altar took up most of the ^N room
     inside]

     [824:in ^N castle ^N Lyonesse|^N dame, a fine imposing ^N edifice in
     smooth pale ^N stone on top of a ^N hill with commanding ^N views of
     the surrounding ^N countryside. Inside, the ^N rooms were light and
     airy, with many interesting ^N pictures and ^N engravings decorating
     the ^N walls, and well-worn comfortable ^N furnishings]

     [825:in a ^N decaying ^N hall. ^N Debris - ^N wood and ^N stones - littered the
     ^N floor and the ^N walls were covered in ^N lichens. A couple of small
     ^N bushes
     had taken root in one of the many ^N cracks in the stone ^N floor]
     [826:in the entrance to ^N chapel ^N perilous. It was a narrow
     ^N passage, with ^N plants overhanging the ^N doorway, creating a green
     ^N light
     which shone into the ^N chapel beyond, much of which seemed to be swathed in
     ^N shadows]

     and thick ^N cobwebs draped many of the ^N statuettes which rested against
     the ^N walls]

     strange ^N ornaments and ^N relics lining the ^N walls and crowding the

     were full of ^N sap, with many small ^N shoots bursting from the ^N tips of the
     ^N sprigs. The ^N wind could be felt much more strongly here and the whole
     ^N tree seemed to
     sway in the ^N breeze]
     ;
     [830:on the ^N stairs. Here the stone ^N steps gave way to a wooden
     ^N construction, which creaked disconcertingly underfoot]
     [831:in the ^N living ^N quarters. The ^N furniture looked old and well-
     used. A few ^N drapes hung from the ^N ceiling, but were quite powerless to

     some unidentifiable ^N drink distilled at the ^N castle nestled against the

     and many of its ^N planks were splintered, or gaping with ^N holes, so that
     the ^N water below was clearly visible]
     [847:outside a ^N manor ^N house. It was taller than most of the
     nearby ^N buildings, made of grey ^N stone, with many high narrow ^N windows.
     ^N Smoke curled up from a central ^N chimney set into the thick ^N thatch]
     [848:in ^N forest ^N Meliot. The dense ^N growth of tall ^N conifers,
     soaring straight up to the ^N sky like
     ^N spires, cut out the ^N sunlight from the ^N forest ^N floor. The ^N ground was
     soft with a ^N carpet of ^N pine ^N needles and spotted with ^N fir ^N cones ]
     [849:on a ^N dangerous ^N road, twisting and winding around ^N boulders,
     and ^N clumps of ^N bushes, from which an ^N ambush could easily be effected.
     The surrounding ^N trees cast long ^N shadows on the ^N track itself]
     [850:on the ^N track outside ^N Turquin's ^N manor, a wide ^N road with
     stony ^N verges, roughly paved with ^N flagstones and lined on either
     ^N side
     with ^N box ^N trees]

     [851:on a ^N forest ^N track, a wide ^N glade dappled with ^N sunlight
     filtering through the broad ^N branches of the ^N trees. The ^N ground was
     spongy with ^N leaves and ^N leaf ^N mould]
     [852:on a ^N roman ^N road beside a ^N turret. The long straight
     ^N highway stretched out as far as the ^N eye could see and had been laid
     with flat ^N stones, although ^N weeds had sprouted plentifully in the
     ^N cracks. The ^N turret threw a long dark ^N shadow across the ^N way]
     [853:at a ^N junction in the ^N forest. The ^N track divided into two
     here, both ^N paths of well-trodden rotting ^N leaves, although the higher
     ^N road looked slightly drier underfoot]

     small ^N stones wedged together]
     [855:at a ^N big ^N clearing beside the ^N castle of ^N forest ^N
     Sauvage. The cool dusk of the ^N forest gave way to sunny ^N grassland, a
     small ^N meadow sprinkled with ^N buttercups and ^N cowslips, and humming with
     ^N bees and other ^N insects]
     [856:on a ^N roman ^N road through ^N briars. The tangled ^N thorns






     stretched out over the ^N road to catch the unwary. Some faded and blowsy
     ^N flowers were still left on the ^N plants, which were thronged with lazy
     ^N bees buzzing from one to the other. The ^N road wove its ^N way through the
     ^N bushes as far as the ^N horizon]
     [857:on a ^N roman road through ^N forest ^N Sauvage, a straight wide
     ^N track stretching deep into the ^N forest. Some paving ^N stones had been
     laid to cover the most obviously muddy ^N parts. The surrounding ^N trees
     curved over the ^N road to create a high ^N arch]
     [858:on the ^N great north road, wide and even as it traversed the
     ^N moors or followed alongside ^N rivers but narrowing to a stony single-
     file ^N track as it wound around ^N hills, or descended into wooded ^N valleys.
     Some ^N parts, where the ^N track was stamped into a hard smooth ^N surface by
     ^N carts and ^N horses' ^N hooves and the ^N roadside was dotted with
     ^N cairns, were
     well-used by ^N travellers, while other ^N sections, where fewer ^N people used
     the ^N road, were more difficult to negotiate]

     ^N weeds and encroaching ^N undergrowth]
     [860:on the ^N coast road, a sandy ^N strip just a few ^N feet above the
     ^N high ^N tide ^N mark. Stubby ^N marram ^N grass and other ^N sea ^N plants lined the
     ^N verges, while empty ^N seashells littered the ^N way, and ^N flotsam from the
     ^N we ^N wall was speckled with
     ^N lichens and small ^N plants wedged into its ^N crevices]

     nearby ^N beach, which crunched underfoot]
     [864:on a ^N beach, where occasional
     ^N crops of dark grey ^N rock pushed out above the fine golden ^N sands, leaving
     deep ^N rock ^N pools at their ^N feet. It was bordered on either ^N side by tall
     ^N headlands protruding into the ^N bay]

     ;
     [866:on a ^N hill, a windswept ^N tor covered in short coarse ^N grass, the
     ^N peak a bare ^N head of hard ^N granite. The ^N slopes were dotted with smaller
     ^N granite ^N outcrops, and mazy ^N rabbit ^N tracks wove from ^N rock to
     ^N rock]
     [867:on a ^N winding ^N road, which negotiated thickly wooded ^N river
     ^N valleys and wound around the ^N foot of bleak ^N moors, sometimes following
     the ^N course of ^N ridges on their lower ^N slopes. ^N Dry ^N stone
     ^N walls marked the
     ^N verges along some ^N sections, while the ^N way meandered alongside small
     twisting ^N streams for long ^N stretches]
     [868:at a ^N crossroads, a large and evidentally busy ^N junction, since
     the ^N track was worn and pitted with ^N footmarks and ^N clefts made by
     ^N horses' ^N hooves. A small ^N patch of straggling ^N grass marked the
     ^N centre of
     the ^N crossing]
     [869:on an ^N island, a huge high ^N boulder flung into the ^N sea a few
     ^N miles from the ^N mainland. The ^N shoreline was mostly ^N cliffs but here and
     there ^N rockfalls had created a sort of ^N beach. Over the central
     ^N plateau of the ^N island grew thin short ^N grass, like a thatched
     ^N roof over
     rocky ^N walls]






     [870:on a ^N shore beside a ^N tower. Small ^N rocks worn smooth by
     centuries of ^N tides made it possible to clamber along the ^N shoreline.
     The ^N tower was built on to solid ^N rock a hundred ^N yards or so back from
     the ^N sea itself, a tall square ^N edifice looking out to ^N sea]
     [871:in ^N Corbin ^N village, a ^N settlement of tiny stone ^N houses, built
     in ^N places to afford as much ^N protection from the ^N wind as possible,
     their ^N doors facing inland, and ^N smoke blowing furiously from nearly all
     the ^N chimneys. A few meagre ^N strips of farmed ^N land could be
     seen behind the ^N cottages, but there was little sign of any ^N inhabitants]
     [872:in a ^N forest ^N maze. The ^N trees grew so close together and the
     smaller ^N branches were so dense it was impossible to see more than few
     ^N yards ahead]

     [873:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [874:in a ^N forest ^N maze]

     [884:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [885:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [886:at the ^N wailing ^N castle, which loomed out of the ^N woods, first
     indistinctly, as the ^N trees hid it from clear ^N view. It might have been
     like something out of a ^N fairy ^N tale, had it not been for the stark ash
     grey ^N contours of the ^N towers, and its utter lack of ^N adornment. There
     was also nothing enchanted about the ^N sounds of pitiful ^N cries, which
     must surely be human, which could be heard indistinctly from the
     inside of the ^N castle]
     [887:in a ^N forest ^N maze]

     ^N birds
     set up a great ^N crying as a ^N wild ^Nanimal searched for ^N food somewhere in
     the ^N distance]
     [896:in a ^N forest ^N ^N land]
     [899:in a ^N trackless ^N marsh. Oily stagnant ^N pools gave way to brown






     shifting ^N mud, with occasional ^N tufts of ^N grasses attempting to gain some
     ^N foothold in this slippery oozing ^N landscape. The ^N ground was
     completely flat for as far as the ^N eye could see, and a grey ^N mist hung
     over the clammy ^N ground]
     [900:on a ^N marsh ^N road. Raised above the level of the brackish
     ^N mud ^N flats, the ^N track had been laid with ^N pebb ^N land]

     ^N mud ^N flats, the ^N track had been laid with ^N pebbles to mark out the drier
     ^N ground, but was nevertheless very wet underfoot]
     [901:at a ^N siegeworks. The ^N trenches and defensive ^N mounds were clearly
     visible, the ^N trenches deep and wide to allow the ^N accommodation of
     horsed ^N knights as well as ^N foot ^N soldiers. Here and there the remains of
     ^N battle
     could be seen - half a ^N sword, or a broken ^N spear, or a scrap of torn
     ^N chain
     ^N mail hanging from a ^N tree]
     [902:in the ^N red ^N launds, bare and baked of ^N earth. The barren
     sandy ^N ground yielded only a few sparse ^N tufts of ^N grass in the way of
     vegetation. The small ^N mounds which served as ^N hills in the ^N vicinity
     were as bare as the ^N vales, which gave the ^N lands the appearance of a
     ^N desert]
     [903:in the ^N green ^N launds. Here the ^N fields were lush and bushy
     with tall vibrant ^N grasses and small ^N shrubs, while the abundant
     ^N hedgerows created a patchwork criss-cross of darker green against the
     brightness of the ^N meadows. It looked as though it might have been
     raining, the ^N countryside looked so fresh and newly washed]
     [904:in the ^N black ^N launds, a scarred ^N land of ^N stubble for ^N grass
     and ^N stumps for ^N trees. The ^N ground was so infertile that in great
     ^N tracts
     the bare dark ^N earth was exposed, no ^N vegetation being able to sustain
     itself in the ^N soil. What ^N trees there were were stunted and thin, with
     shrivelled ^N leaves and spindly ^N twigs for branches]
     [905:at a ^N country ^N junction. Despite it being a major ^N meeting of
     the ^N roads, it was evidentally not well-travelled. ^N Grass grew across
     all the ^N tracks, and wild ^N hawthorn ^N trees overhung the ^N crossing, having
     not been cut back to make the ^N junction clearer or wider, either
     deliberately or through any sustained ^N traffic]
     [906:at a ^N main ^N road, a wide smooth ^N highway, lined at regular
     ^N intervals with broad ^N elm ^N trees, which gave it the appearance of a regal
     ^N avenue]
     [907:on a ^N country ^N road, with ^N dry ^N stone ^N walls lining the
     ^N route.
     Against the ^N walls grew ^N blackberry ^N bushes, which made even the
     negotiable part of the ^N road quite narrow and difficult in places]
     [908:on a ^N stone ^N road, paved with large ^N flagstones to make the
     going as even and steady as possible. ^N Mosses and small ^N ferns
     grew in the ^N gaps in the ^N stones, and spread up the squat ^N walls which
     marked the ^N verges of the ^N road]
     [909:on an ^N overgrown ^N road. It was difficult to see the exact
     ^N path, so tangled and knotted were the ^N bushes and creeping
     ^N plants which encroached on either ^N side]
     [910:on an ^N overgrown ^N road, where outflung ^N branches caught the
     unwary ^N rider across the ^N face, and fallen ^N trees lay across the
     ^N track,
     completely blocking the ^N way. Tall ^N foxgloves grew in the very middle of
     the ^ way, forming a regimental ^N line bisecting the ^N road into two
     ^N lanes]
     [911:on a ^N hill, beside a ^N tower. The ^N slopes were bare and craggy,
     the ^N rocks showing through the straggling ^N tufts of ^N grass and ground
     ^N plants. A cold ^N wind blew from the north from which little ^N shelter
     could be found, and echoed round the ^N tower, which had a battered
     appearance, as though it had barely withstood some of the harsher






     winter ^N gales]
     [912:on a ^N beach, a small ^N bay forming a deep ^N curve between two
     jagged ^N headlands. Seaweed covered ^N rocks were strewn all over the
     ^N strand, with deep ^N rock and sand ^N pools which made the going tricky]
     [913:on a ^N mountaintop, up in the midst of grey swirling ^N clouds. the
     ^N vegetation had ceased altogether here, and the ^N ground was bare lichen-
     covered ^N rock, which had been worn smooth by the ^N r and ^N gorse ^N bushes forming a colourful
     ^N patchowrk of purple and yellow on the ^N hillsides]
     [916:in the ^N Orkneys, dozens of ^N islands, some like small ^N rocks
     hurled at random into the ^N sea. The larger, inhabited ^N islands were bare
     and windswept, with short thick ^N grass interspersed with stunted ^N trees,
     blown sideways from the ^N roots by the prevailing ^N winds. A few hardy
     ^N sheep, protected from the ^N gales by their luxuriant wool
     ^N coats, r and ^N gorse ^N bushes forming a colourful
     ^N patchowrk of purple and yellow on the ^N hillsides]

     ^N elements]

     [917:in ^N Scotland, a land of fertile broadleaved ^N woods and lush
     ^N pasture in the south, yielding to the majesty of imposing ^N peaks and
     deep narrow ^N lochs in the north, the ^N valleys covered in dark secretive
     ^N pine
     ^N forests, the gentle lower ^N slopes of the ^N hills carpeted with springy
     ^N heather and the bright yellow of ^N gorse. Occasionally small rough stone
     ^N dwellings and untidy ^N villages could be seen where the ^N terrain
     allowed for ^N habitation]
     [918:in the ^N marches, a bleak ^N no-man's ^N land of the oft-disputed
     ^N borders between ^N Scotland and the ^N realm of ^N Logris. The ^N area was criss-
     crossed with ^N walls built to mark the ^N ownership of the ^N lands they
     separated. Some had obviously been fought over, won and lost long
     before, since the ^N battlements were disused and some nearly reduced to
     ^N rubble, while others still stood strong, their ^N towers tall
     against the ^N skyline  ]
     [919:in an ^N apple ^N tree ^N clearing beside ^N castle ^N Chariot.
     The sweet smell of the ^N trees lent the small ^N lea an enchanted ^N air,
     which was somewhat marred by the functional square ^N lines and garrison-
     like ^N appearance of the ^N castle itself]

     gave a firm steady ^N foothold]
     ;; [921:at the top of the ^N elm. The smaller ^N branches swayed in the

     [925:in the upper stories of the tower. The rooms, two to each storey,
     were scarcely furnished at all. In some, there was only a few emoty
     sacks laid against a wall or a couple of wooden stools. A few moth-
     eaten drapes covered some of the draughtier walls. Finding nothing of interest,
     Lancelot returned to the stairs beside the living quarters]
     [926:in some thick woodland. He could not see the way ahead so thick
     were the bushes and greenery and tripped constantly over creeping
     plants and tree roots. Finding no semblance of a track through the
     undergrowth, he then returned to the path]






     [927:in King Pellam's castle. King Pellam himself came out to greet
     Lancelot, and after the customary pleasantries, settled him down with
     a jug of ale to talk seriously. The King, it soon transpired, wished
     to discuss with Lancelot the nature of the Holy Grail, the sacred
     vessel from which Jesus Christ had drunk and which had been brought to
     the realm by Joseph of Arimathea.% % Soon, the King assured Lancelot,
     it would appear, briefly and magically, to the knights at Camelot, but
     only when the time was right and a knight pure enough in heart to
     achieve its blessing was present.% %King Pellam seemed to be compelled
     to reveal to Lancelot many of the details of the quest for the Grail
     which the Knights of the Round Table would undertake in the name of
     King Arthur and the kingdom of Logris. Lancelot heardPellam reiterate
     that only the noblest and most honourable of the knights would
     eventually achieve the quest, although many would try and lose their
     lives in the attempt, and he felt his heart stir at the challenge
     which he hoped lay ahead of him. The king went on, drawing imaginary
     maps on the table top with his fingers to show how far and wide the
     knights would travel on their quests, both individually and together.%
     % Lancelot listened intently at first. He knew full well of the
     Grail's legend and that the highest honour he, or any other knight,
     could attain would be to seek and find the Grail, and be cleansed and
     purified by it. He had hoped that the King might tell him more than he
     knew already and perhaps give him some clues  he started]

     [930:in Sir Ector's castle. He greeted his brother warmly and they

     a set piece in the centre, but they had obviously not been tended for
     some time, and wer enow mostly going to seed]
     [1102:in a ^N secret ^N passage . Occasional rockfalls indicated that the tunnel
     ceiling was not entirely stable, and in one place the fallen stone
     shad to be cleared to make the way passable]
     [1103:in the ^N entrance]
     [1104:in a ^N gateway]
     [1105:in a ^N cell . A pile of straw, evidentally for sleeping on, lay
     in one corner, but it was sodden and gave no protection from the hard
     stone floor]
     [1106:in a ^N prison ^N corridor . The ground was alternately stony
     and mulchy with earth, and the walls felt soft and crumbly]
     [1107:in a ^N cell . There were marks scored on to the walls, as
     previous prisoners had counted up the days of their incarceration]
     [1108:in a ^N prison]
     [1109:on ^N deck . The deck was long and narrow, and Lancelot could
     ony keep his footing by firmly gripping the rope handrail which ran
     around the ship. Far above him, the sails billowed and rustled in the
     wind]
     [1110:in a ^N castle . The windows were little more than slits, and
     let little natural light into the gloomy chambers]
     [1111:in a ^N prison . Every sound echoed eerily around the caverns,
     and there was a constant drip-drip of water]
     [1112:on some ^N stairs]
     [1113:in a room with a ^N bath . The whole chamber was misty with
     steam, mixed, it must be said, with smoke from the fire and it was
     difficult to see clearly from one end of the room to the other ]
     [1114:in a ^N hall]
     [1115:on some ^N stairs]
     [1116:in the ^N perilous ^N bedroom . Tattered drapes in a heavy grey
     cloth added to the shadows, and billowed slightly from time to time
     from the draughts behind them]
     [1117:in the lower branches of the ^N elm]
     [1118:in Elaine's ^N bedroom and the air was heavy with a musky scent.
     The overall effect was quite intoxicating]
     [1119:in a ^N chapel beside a ^N tomb , its candleabra and vessels
     brightly polished and kept in good condition, and its simple silk frontal
     clean and uncreased, in marked contrast to the rough simplicity of the
     rest of the interior]
     [1120:in ^N castle ^N Lyonesse|^N dame]
     [1121:in a ^N decaying ^N hall . Sandy and rubble had accumulated at
     the foot of the walls, and cobwebs hung from the pillars]
     [1122:in the entrance to ^N chapel ^N perilous]
     [1123:inside the ^N chapel]
     [1124:in the ^N inner ^N chamber . The air smelt stalof dark
     wood]
     [1130:on the ^N stairs]
     [1131:in the ^N basement . A pile of dusty hessian sacks lay piled up
     against the far corner. Some had split and little mounds of grain had
     spilt on to the floor in front of them]

     [1132:in a ^N tunnel . The underground seemed to lead downhill for
     much of the way, and obviously reached far into the depths of the
     earth]
     [1133:in a ^N prison . Judging from its dimensions - the low ceiling
     and very few windows - of dark
     wood]
     [1130:on the ^N stairs]
     [1131:in the ^N basement . A pile of dusty hessian sacks lay piled up
     against the far corner. Some had split and little mounds of grain had
     spilt on to the floor in front of them]

     [1132:in a ^N tunnel . The underground seemed to lead downhill for
     much of the way, and obviously reached far into the depths of the
     earth]
     [1133:in a ^N prison . Judging from its dimensions - the low ceiling
     and very few windows - it had probably been converted from a stable or
     grain storage barn]
     [1134:in a ^N guardroom]
     [1135:in an ^N upper ^N prison]

     [1136:on a ^N riverbank . The river was wide here and flowed lazily,
     while a few stagnant mudpools had collected on the path, choked with
     green algae ]
     [1137:on a ^N decrepit ^N bridge . Much of the wooden sides had been
     washed away, and although parts of the bridge walls had been filled
     in with ropes lashed to what remained of the central arch, it
     looked as though it would take little effort to send the whole
     structure crashing into the river]
     [1138:outside a ^N manor ^N house . The grounds surrounding it had
     been neatly tended, with lawns and smart shrubberies, and a herb
     garden on the south facing side]
     [1139:in ^N forest ^N Meliot . Squirrels could be seen darting from
     branch to branch, and there was evidence too that larger animals and
     game frequented the woods]
     [1140:on a ^N dangerous ^N road]
     [1141:on the ^N track outside ^N Turquin's ^N manor . The road led
     straight and unswervingly up to the gate to the manor itself]
     [1142:on a ^N forest ^N track]
     [1143:on a ^N roman ^N road beside a ^N turret , a square building
     with a crenellated roof]
     [1144:at a ^N junction in the ^N forest]
     [1145:in ^N Garlon's ^N turret . The moss which grew plentifully up
     the sides of the tower gave it a patchworked effect ]
     [1146:at a ^N big ^N clearing beside the ^N castle of ^N forest ^N Sauvage]
     [1147:on a ^N roman ^N road through ^N briars]
     [1148:on a ^N roman road through ^N forest ^N Sauvage]
     [1149:on the ^N great north road . Smaller tracks led off to the
     villages and settlements along the way, and makeshift milestones marked the
     relevant
     distances along the route, although many of the letters cut into the
     rock had become faded or overgrown and were difficult to read]
     [1150:on a ^N triumphal ^N avenue|^N Camelot ^N Arthur ^N Guenever]
     [1151:on the ^N coast road]
     [1152:at ^N Tintagel . The countryside to the south was fertile and
     gently rolling, in contrast to the harsh coastline. In the sea far below
     the castle, seals basked in the sun and sported in the rough waters]
     [1153:on a ^N walled ^N road . Beyond the road were wide rolling
     fields of pasture, where sheep were grazing contentedly and a few
     peasants', or shepherds', huts could be espied in the distance]






     [1154:on a ^N road]
     [1155:on a ^N beach , the hinterland behind comprising gently
     undulating dunes receding into fallow fields beyond]
     ;
     [1166:on a ^N hill]
     [1167:on a ^N winding ^N road]
     [1168:at a ^N crossroads . In this central patch a smooth round
     boulder had acted as a signpost, with directions etched into it, but
     wind, rain and the moss covering most of the stone had rendered these
     unreadable]
     [1169:on an ^N island . The air was alive with seabirds, shrieking and
     wailing over vast overpopulated colonies they had created on the
     cliff ledges]
     [1170:on a ^N shore beside a ^N tower , capped with notched
     battlements, and pitted with narrow arched windows]
     [1171:in ^N Corbin ^N village . The cottages lined the main road
     through the village, and further up, clustered around the small stone
     church]

     [1184:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [1185:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [1186:at the ^N wailing ^N castle . The castle was not protected by a
     moat, but a rougmaze]
     [1197:on a ^N forest ^N road]
     [1198:on a ^N reedy ^N isle beside a ^N castle . For all that, it
     looked strong and well-built, although, rising out of the marshy mists
     as it did, it had a semblance of insubstantiality about it, as though
     its solid walls hovered above the ground]
     [1199:in a ^N trackless ^N marsh]
     [1200:on a ^N marsh ^N road]
     [1201:at a ^N siegeworks . Despite its present usage, it was all too

     [1201:at a ^N siegeworks . Despite its present usage, it was all too
     easy to hear the echoes of past
     battles, and ghosts of long-dead knights, which seemed to linger on the air]
     [1202:in the ^N red ^N launds]
     [1203:in the ^N green ^N launds]
     [1204:in the ^N black ^N launds]

     [1211:on a ^N hill, beside a ^N tower]
     [1212:on a ^N beach]
     [1213:on a ^N mountaintop . The sense of solitude was all-pervading,
     with any views of the terrain below masked by the damp mists]
     [1214:on a ^N mountainside . Long narrow runs of scree overflowed the
     path in places, and made travelling more of a scramble than riding in
     a straight line]
     [1215:on a ^N glen]
     [1216:in the ^N Orkneys . The settlements were made up of low stout
     crofts, huddled together for shelter from the constant gales. Many had
     not endured the wilder storms and lay open-topped and ruined, either
     deserted or used as makeshift sheep pens]
     [1217:in ^N Scotland . It was a wildly beautiful country, and much
     feared and renowned for the ferocity and hardiness of its inhabitants,
     who would defend their land, infertile and inhospitable as much of it
     was, against any aggressor]
     [1218:in the ^N marches]
     [1219:in an ^N apple ^N

     [1225:in the upper stories of the tower. Finding nothing of interest,
     Lancelot returned to the stairs beside the living quarters]
     [1226:in some thick woodland, and then returned to the path]
     [1227:in King Pellam's castle. He visited King Pellam,
     who told him about the Holy Grail. Then he made his excuses and left]
     [1228:on some more stairs. Lancelot explored some of
     the rest of the castle, then returned to where he started]
     [1229:about to land on the stony rocks, when a sudden gust
     of wind blew the boat back into the water]
     [1230:in Sir Ector's castle. After brief pleasantries, he
     returned outside]
     [1231:right outside the castle, but could find no way in, so
     he returned to the road]

     of a tidy little village with a dominating castle]
     [1341:shore at the western side of a huge expanse of water]
     [1344:shore beside the isle of Servage]
     [1348:under a daunting, climbable rock cliff. At the top of the
     cliff could be seen a castle worthy of the most horrific of
     horror films]

     [1350:in the ^N lower ^N prison . Lancelot gagged in the fetid air]
     [1351:in the ^N courtyard]
     [1352:in a ^N secret ^N passage . Lancelot's armour made him clumsy
     and heavy-footed, but at least the metal protected him from grazing
     arms and legs on the jagged walls]
     [1353:in the ^N entrance]
     [1354:in a ^N gateway]
     [1355:in a ^N cell . Lancelot looked all around for a means of escape,
     but could see no obvious weakness in the cell's construction]
     [1356:in a ^N prison ^N corridor . He peered right and left at the
     cells along the passage, but all were locked shut. Only mufflele's residents were built
     to massive proportions]
     [1361:in a ^N prison . Lancelot tried to memorise the layout of the
     prison, certain that he would lose his bearings otherwise]
     [1362:on some ^N stairs]
     [1363:in a room with a ^N bath . Lancelot let the warmth of the room
     seep into him for some moments, until he had to wipe the sweat from
     his brow]
     [1364:in a ^N hall . He gazed at the trophies with interest,
     recognising some of the battle scenes from talesle's residents were built
     to massive proportions]
     [1361:in a ^N prison . Lancelot tried to memorise the layout of the
     prison, certain that he would lose his bearings otherwise]
     [1362:on some ^N stairs]
     [1363:in a room with a ^N bath . Lancelot let the warmth of the room
     seep into him for some moments, until he had to wipe the sweat from
     his brow]
     [1364:in a ^N hall . He gazed at the trophies with interest,
     recognising some of the battle scenes from tales told to him in his
     boyhood]
     [1365:on some ^N stairs]
     [1366:in the ^N perilous ^N bedroom . He felt a great sense of unease
     in the room, which he couldn't immediately explain]
     [1367:in the lower branches of the ^N elm . Tree-climbing had been one
     of Lancelot's favourite pastimes in his younger, more carefree days,
     and he was rather proud to show off his agility and strength to the young
     maiden below]
     [1368:in Elaine's ^N bedroom . Lancelot could feel conflicting
     emotions pulling at him, and the temptation of the seductive
     atmosphere was almost more than he could bear. Guenever suddenly
     seemed a long way away, a shadowy figure in his thoughts]
     [1369:in a ^N chapel beside a ^N tomb]
     [1370:in ^N castle ^N Lyonesse|^N dame . Lancelot felt comforted by
     its homely appearance after his long hard days of travelling]
     [1371:in a ^N decaying ^N hall]
     [1372:in the entrance to ^N chapel ^N perilous]
     [1373:inside the ^N chapel . Despite its ramshackle appearance,
     Lancelot felt a spiritual peace imbuing him, as he did in all places
     of worship, and he knelt briefly to pray, before rising to his feet to
     look around the small building some more]
     [1374:in the ^N inner ^N chamber]
     [1375:at the top of the ^N elm]
     ;
     [1376:on the ^N stairs]
     [1377:in the ^N living ^N quarters]






     [1378:on the ^N stairs]
     [1379:in a ^N stable]
     [1380:on the ^N stairs]
     [1381:in the ^N basement . Lancelot was hardly tempted to try out any
     of the casks, deciding that they probably contained some undrinkable
     brew of the local firewater]
     [1382:in a ^N tunnel . Lancelot scarcely dared to breathe lest he
     should bring the whole structure down upon his head to bury him alive]
     [1383:in a ^N prison . For a moment, he wondered if he could possibly
     dig himself out, but the ground soil was packed hard, and, he mused,
     it would probably take him months]
     [1384:in a ^N guardroom]
     [1385:in an ^N upper ^N prison]
     [1386:on a ^N riverbank]
     [1387:on a ^N decrepit ^N bridge . Lancelot gripped the reins more
     tightly and forced his horse to face the bridge in a straight line
     down the middle before attempting to ride across]
     [1388:outside a ^N manor ^N house]
     [1389:in ^N forest ^N Meliot . Lancelot inhaled deeply, enjoyed the
     heavy piny scent]
     [1390:on a ^N dangerous ^N road. He glanced from side to side warily
     as he spurred his horse along the track]
     [1391:on the ^N track outside ^N Turquin's ^N manor. Lancelot steeled
     himself to meet the adversary within]

     [1392:on a ^N forest ^N track . It was easy riding, and lancelot
     spurred his horse on to a good pace]
     [1393:on a ^N roman ^N road beside a ^N turret]
     [1394:at a ^N junction in the ^N forest]
     [1395:in ^N Garlon's ^N turret]
     [1396:at a ^N big ^N clearing beside the ^N castle of ^N forest ^N
     Sauvage . He was seized by an absurd desire to dismount and sleep for
     a while in the meadow, but his shook these thought off, reminding
     himself that he yet had much to do]
     [1397:on a ^N roman ^N road through ^N briars . Lancelot clanged his
     visor shut to avoid being scratched in the face]
     [1398:on a ^N roman road through ^N forest ^N Sauvage]
     [1399:on the ^N great north road . Several times Lancelot stoped
     simply to admire the views over the wild moorlands ]

     [1400:on a ^N triumphal ^N avenue|^N Camelot ^N Arthur ^N Guenever]
     [1401:on the ^N coast road]
     [1402:at ^N Tintagel . He felt that no other lands in the realm could
     rival this coastland for its savage splendour, as he watching the
     seals making light of the strong currents and waves which hit the
     rocks with such fury]
     [1403:on a ^N walled ^N road]
     [1404:on a ^N road]
     [1405:on a ^N beach . Lancelot steered his horse to walk along the
     water's edge, so tt it a quite desolate place]
     [1410:on a ^N shore beside a ^N tower]

     [1416:in a ^N forest ^N maze . Lancelot stopped and looked around him,
     angry with himself for losing the path]

     [1418:in a ^N forest ^N maze]

     [1430:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [1431:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [1432:in a ^N forest ^N maze . Lancelot began to wonder if he would

     [1438:on a ^N reedy ^N isle beside a ^N castle]
     [1439:in a ^N trackless ^N marsh . Visions of the horse sinking deep
     into the mud, taking him in his heavy armour down with it, taunted
     Lancelot]
     [1440:on a ^N marsh ^N road]
     [1441:at a ^N siegeworks]
     [1442:in the ^N red ^N launds]
     [1443:in the ^N green ^N launds]
     [1444:in the ^N black ^N launds . There must have been a massively
     fierce heath fire to have caused this much devastation, thought Lancelot]
     [1445:at a ^N country ^N junction]
     [1446:at a ^N main ^N road]
     [1447:on a ^N country ^N road]
     [1448:on a ^N stone ^N road]
     [1449:on an ^N overgrown ^N road . Lancelot ducked and wove under the
     twigs and branches]
     [1450:on an ^N overgrown ^N road]
     [1451:on a ^N hill, beside a ^N tower]

     [1464:the giant spoke, "Sir Lancelot, it is prophesied that I can only
     be killed by a blow from a saint's right hand. I removed the right
     hand from the only saint I've ever met, and now use it as a pillow.
     Therefore, be afraid. Be very afraid, for tomorrow you shall die"
     Then the giant returned to his bed to sleep. ]

     [1473:Lancelot found a fiendly dragon in the chapel, resting across
     the altar and chewing on a skull. He leapt to the attack, but found
     the dragon's fire and stell-like talons almost a match for his
     strength nimble swordwork. The fight lasted from noon to dusk, but
     eventually, Lancelot , although wounded with deep scratches and burns
     to his arms and hands, managed to slay the flagging
     beast with one desperate lunging blow.%
     %Sir Lancelot leaned upon his sword, tired nigh unto death. ]

     [1474:dame Lyoness greeted Lancelot and thanked him for rescuing
     her estates. She said that she must reward him for his valour and
     after some thought, she offered him the services of the
     Red Knight and added that Lynet, the Damosel Maledisant, could stay
     with him. She then retired to tend to her wounded soldiers, and
     graciously sent Lancelot on his way. ]

     [1475:the damosel explained tearfully to Lancelot that Sir Meliot could
     only be cured by a cloth from the Chapel Perilous, but that the chapel
     was guarded heavily and with enhcant the castle prison. ]

     think of pleasantries, he realised that Elaine was blushingly flirting
     with him. In fact, she made her love for him plain, and eventually she
     invited him to stay the night. Taking him by the hand, she led him to
     the bed chambers, and then paused in the corridor outside. She
     breathed, "Come to me tonight, my love", and then slipped quietly into
     her room]

     [2612:Lancelot entered the room and saw Elaine's naked body behind the
     net curtains around the bed. Did he withdraw? ]






     [2613:Lancelot locked the door behind him.
     The ecstasy of that night would stay with him forever. But so would
     his betrayal of his love Guenever. Yet somehow Lancelot knew that his
     actions of the night would eventually act for good]

     set, resolved to continue
     to be faithful to Guenever]

     [2618:Lancelot fell asleep straight away. But during the night
     he was awakened by the noise of the panel opening]
     [2619:a glowing spear flew from the open panel. It hit Lancelot in the
     shoulder, wounding him badly, then it vanished. The panel ground shut
     again]
     [2620:a magical knight emerged]
     [2621:an old man emerged. He was enveloped in adders which seethed
     constantly around him. He was carrying a spear of vengeance]
     [2622:four gentlewomen and a bishop emerged, then retreated back through
     the panel, which closed again]
     [2623:finally, a cock crowed in the castle grounds, and the bedroom door
     opened to permit Lancelot to leave]
     [2624:the knight staggered back through the open panel, only to emerge
     again a moment later, completely healed and stronger than ever]
     [2625:the panel moved a little, but would not close completely]

     delivered his message. Then he returned through the panel]
     [2629:as Lancelot left, Elaine forced a drink into his hands, a
     sparkling ruby-red liquid in a clear crystal glass. He drank
     deeply, and felt a peaceful warmth seep deep into his body at the
     very first draught. When he looked up at Elaine, her face seemed to
     have grown large and luminous in his gaze, and he could remember no
     other human being but her. It was, as Lancelot himself dimly realised
     even under its spell, an enchanted
     love potion (from some random witch or other)! Enthralled in its powers, he
     slept with Elaine, but without guilt, for he had no strength, physical
     or mental, to resist. He
     realised that he had been fated to sire a son by Elaine,
     regardless of anything he might have tried to do to avoid it
     Afterwards, he left Corbin Castle, never to return]
     [2630:the panel was open, but nothing could be seen through the gap, and
     an invisible force prevented Lancelot from feeling behind it]
