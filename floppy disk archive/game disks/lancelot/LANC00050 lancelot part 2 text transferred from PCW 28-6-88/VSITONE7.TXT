     [1350:in the ^N lower ^N prison . Lancelot gagged in the fetid air]
     [1351:in the ^N courtyard]
     [1352:in a ^N secret ^N passage . Lancelot's armour made him clumsy
     and heavy-footed, but at least the metal protected him from grazing
     arms and legs on the jagged walls]
     [1353:in the ^N entrance]
     [1354:in a ^N gateway]
     [1355:in a ^N cell . Lancelot looked all around for a means of escape,
     but could see no obvious weakness in the cell's construction]
     [1356:in a ^N prison ^N corridor . He peered right and left at the
     cells along the passage, but all were locked shut. Only muffled groans
     and cries told him that others were held here too]
     [1357:in a ^N cell . Lancelot knocked on the walls, but they all
     seemed quite solid, and he knew he had no means of reaching the grille]
     [1358:in a ^N prison . Lancelot shivered in the chilly air]
     [1359:on ^N deck . The heavy rocking of the ship nearly caused him to
     keel over once or twice]
     [1360:in a ^N castle . Lancelot was amazed at the dimensions of the
     chambers, and could only guess that the castle's residents were built
     to massive proportions]
     [1361:in a ^N prison . Lancelot tried to memorise the layout of the
     prison, certain that he would lose his bearings otherwise]
     [1362:on some ^N stairs]
     [1363:in a room with a ^N bath . Lancelot let the warmth of the room

     his brow]

     recognising some of the battle scenes from tales told to him in his
     boyhood]

     [1367:in the lower branches of the ^N elm . Tree-climbing had been one
     of Lancelot's favourite pastimes in his younger, more carefree days,
     and he was rather proud to show off his agility and strength to the young
     maiden below]
     [1368:in Elaine's ^N bedroom . Lancelot could feel conflicting
     emotions pulling at him, and the temptation of the seductive
     atmosphere was almost more than he could bear. Guenever suddenly
     seemed a long way away, a shadowy figure in his thoughts]
     [1369:in a ^N chapel beside a ^N tomb]
     [1370:in ^N castle ^N Lyonesse|^N dame . Lancelot felt comforted by

     [1371:in a ^N decaying ^N hall]
     [1372:in the entrance to ^N chapel ^N perilous]
     [1373:inside the ^N chapel . Despite its ramshackle appearance,
     Lancelot felt a spiritual peace imbuing him, as he did in all places
     of worship, and he knelt briefly to pray, before rising to his feet to
     look around the small building some more]
     [1374:in the ^N inner ^N chamber]

     [1379:in a ^N stable]
     [1380:on the ^N stairs]
     [1381:in the ^N basement . Lancelot was hardly tempted to try out any
     of the casks, deciding that they probably containe^N decrepit ^N bridge . Lancelot gripped the reins more

     [1389:in ^N forest ^N Meliot . Lancelot inhaled deeply, enjoyed the

     as he spurred his horse along the track]

     [1394:at a ^N junction in the ^N forest]
     [1395:in ^N Garlon's ^N turret]
     [1396:at a ^N big ^N clearing beside the ^N castle of ^N forest ^N
     Sauvage . He was seized by an absurd desire to dismount and sleep for
     a while in the meadow, but his shook these thought off, reminding
     himself that he yet had much to do]

     [1402:at ^N Tintagel . He felt that no other lands in the realm could
     rival this coastland for its savage splendour, as he watching the
     seals making light of the strong currents and waves which hit the
     rocks with such fury]
     [1403:on a ^N walled ^N road]
     [1404:on a ^N road]
     [1405:on a ^N beach . Lancelot steered his horse to walk along the
     water's edge, so that its prints would be washed away quickly by the incoming
     tide]
     ;
     [1406:on a ^N hill . Lancelot caught sight of a couple of rabbits,
     their white bob-tails flashing through the tufts of grass]
     [1407:on a ^N winding ^N road . He guided his horse carefully, fearing
     it would twist a leg on some of the rockier stretches]

     ;
     [1464:the giant spoke, "Sir Lancelot, it is prophesied that I can only
     be killed by a blow from a saint's right hand. I removed the right
     hand from the only saint I've ever met, and now use it as a pillow.
     Therefore, be afraid. Be very afraid, for tomorrow you shall die"
     Then the giant returned to his bed to sleep. ]

     [1473:Lancelot found a fiendly dragon in the chapel, resting across
     the altar and chewing on a skull. He leapt to the attack, but found
     the dragon's fire and stell-like talons almost a match for his
     strength nimble swordwork. The fight lasted from noon to dusk, but
     eventually, Lancelot , although wounded with deep scratches and burns

     beast with one desperate lunging blow.%

     after some thought, she offered him the services of the
     Red Knight and added that Lynet, the Damosel Maledisant, could stay
     with him. She then retired to tend to her wounded soldiers, and
     graciously sent Lancelot on his way. ]

     [1475:the damosel explained tearfully to Lancelot that Sir Meliot could

     [1519:some fishermen appeared and strode up to Lancelot. Speaking in
     an undertone, as if afraid of being overheard, they warned him about the lord

     currently awaiting his doom in the castle prison. ]
