     [1100:in the ^N lower ^N prison . Lancelot could see no sign of any
     furnishings, not even a ledge in the wall to sit upon]
     [1101:in the ^N courtyard . A few straggling plants attempted to make
     a set piece in the centre, but they had obviously not been tended for
     some time, and wer enow mostly going to seed]
     [1102:in a ^N secret ^N passage . Occasional rockfalls indicated that the tunnel
     ceiling was not entirely stable, and in one place the fallen stone
     shad to be cleared to make the way passable]
     [1103:in the ^N entrance]
     [1104:in a ^N gateway]
     [1105:in a ^N cell . A pile of straw, evidentally for sleeping on, lay
     in one corner, but it was sodden and gave no protection from the hard
     stone floor]
     [1106:in a ^N prison ^N corridor . The ground was alternately stony
     and mulchy with earth, and the walls felt soft and crumbly]
     [1107:in a ^N cell . There were marks scored on to the walls, as
     previous prisoners had counted up the days of their incarceration]
     [1108:in [1112:on some ^N stairs]
     [1113:in a room with a ^N bath . The whole chamber was misty with
     steam, mixed, it must be said, with smoke from the fire and it was
     difficult to see clearly from one end of the room to the other ]
     [1114:in a ^N hall]
     [1115:on some ^N stairs]
     [1116:in the ^N perilous ^N bedroom . Tattered drapes in a heavy grey
     cloth added to the shadows, and billowed slightly from time to time
     from the draughts behind them]
     [1117:in the lower br[1112:on some ^N stairs]
     [1113:in a room with a ^N bath . The whole chamber was misty with
     steam, mixed, it must be said, with smoke from the fire and it was
     difficult to see clearly from one end of the room to the other ]
     [1114:in a ^N hall]
     [1115:on some ^N stairs]
     [1116:in the ^N perilous ^N bedroom . Tattered drapes in a heavy grey
     cloth added to the shadows, and billowed slightly from time to time
     from the draughts behind them]
     [1117:in the lower branches of the ^N elm]
     [1118:in Elaine's ^N bedroom and the air was heavy with a musky scent.
     The overall effect was quite intoxicating]
     [1119:in a ^N chapel beside a ^N tomb , its candleabra and vessels
     brightly polished and kept in good condition, and its simple silk frontal
     clean and uncreased, in marked contrast to the rough simplicity of the
     rest of the interior]
     [1120:in ^N castle ^N Lyonesse|^N dame]
     [1121:in a ^N decaying ^N hall . Sandy and rubble had accumulated at
     the foot of the walls, and cobwebs hung from the pillars]
     [1122:in the entrance to ^N chapel ^N perilous]
     [1123:inside the ^N chapel]
     [1124:in the ^N inner ^N chamber . The air smelt stale, as though no-
     one had used the room for decades]
     [1125:at the top of the ^N elm]
     ;
     [1126:on the ^N stairs]






     [1127:in the ^N living ^N quarters . An old suit of armour stood in
     one corner, a souvenir, perhaps, of a past battle, but it too was
     showing its age and was mottled with rust]
     [1128:on the ^N stairs]
     [1129:in a ^N stable , some with their ropes still attached, and the
     room was divided into stalls with some thin ricketty planks of dark
     wood]
     [1130:on the ^N stairs]
     [1131:in the ^N basement . A pile of dusty hessian sacks lay piled up
     against the far corner. Some had split and little mounds of grain had
     spilt on to the floor in front of them]

     [1132:in a ^N tunnel . The underground seemed to lead downhill for
     much of the way, and obviously reached far into the depths of the
     earth]
     [1133:in a ^N prison . Judging from its dimensions - the low ceiling
     and very few windows - it had probably been converted from a stable or
     grain storage barn]
     [1134:in a ^N guardroom]
     [1135:in an ^N upper ^N prison]

     [1136:on a ^N riverbank . The river was wide here and flowed lazily,
     while a few stagnant mudpools had collected on the path, choked with
     green algae ]
     [1137:on a ^N decrepit ^N bridge . Much of the wooden sides had been
     washed away, and although parts of the bridge walls had been filled
     in with ropes lashed to what remained of the central arch, it
     looked as though it would take little effort to send the whole
     structure crashing into the river]
     [1138:outside a ^N manor ^N house . The grounds surrounding it had
     been neatly tended, with lawns and smart shrubberies, and a herb
     garden on the south facing side]
     [1139:in ^N forest ^N Meliot . Squirrels could be seen darting from
     branch to branch, and there was evidence too that larger animals and
     game frequented the woods]
     [1140:on a ^N dangerous ^N road]
     [1141:on the ^N track outside ^N Turquin's ^N manor . The road led
     straight and unswervingly up to the gate to the manor itself]
     [1142:on a ^N forest ^N track]
     [1143:on a ^N roman ^N road beside a ^N turret , a square building
     with a crenellated roof]
     [1144:at a ^N junction in the ^N forest]
     [1145:in ^N Garlon's ^N turret . The moss which grew plentifully up
     the sides of the tower gave it a patchworked effect ]
     [1146:at a ^N big ^N clearing beside the ^N castle of ^N forest ^N Sauvage]
     [1147:on a ^N roman ^N road through ^N briars]
     [1148:on a ^N roman road through ^N forest ^N Sauvage]
     [1149:on the ^N great north road . Smaller tracks led off to the
     villages and settlements along the way, and makeshift milestones marked the
     relevant
     distances along the route, although many of the letters cut into the
     rock had become faded or overgrown and were difficult to read]
     [1150:on a ^N triumphal ^N avenue|^N Camelot ^N Arthur ^N Guenever]
     [1151:on the ^N coast road]
     [1152:at ^N Tintagel . The countryside to the south was fertile and
     gently rolling, in contrast to the harsh coastline. In the sea far below
     the castle, seals basked in the sun and sported intral patch a smooth round
     boulder had acted as a signpost, with directions etched into it, but
     wind, rain and the moss covering most of the stone had rendered these
     unreadable]
     [1169:on an ^N island . The air was alive with seabirds, shrieking and
     wailing over vast overpopulated colonies they had created on the
     cliff ledges]
     [1170:on a ^N shore beside a ^N tower , capped with notched
     battlements, and pitted with narrow arched windows]
     [1171:in ^N Corbin tral patch a smooth round
     boulder had acted as a signpost, with directions etched into it, but
     wind, rain and the moss covering most of the stone had rendered these
     unreadable]
     [1169:on an ^N island . The air was alive with seabirds, shrieking and
     wailing over vast overpopulated colonies they had created on the
     cliff ledges]
     [1170:on a ^N shore beside a ^N tower , capped with notched
     battlements, and pitted with narrow arched windows]
     [1171:in ^N Corbin ^N village . The cottages lined the main road
     through the village, and further up, clustered around the small stone
     church]
     [1172:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [1173:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [1174:in a ^N forest ^N maze]

     [1182:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [1183:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [1184:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [1185:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [1186:at the ^N wailing ^N castle . The castle was not protected by a
     moat, but a rough track led off the path straight to an immense door,
     made out of solid oak and reinforced with metal straps. It appeared to
     be very firmly shut]
     [1187:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [1188:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [1189:in a ^N forest ^N maze]

     [1194:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [1195:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [1196:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [1197:on a ^N forest ^N road]
     [1198:on a ^N reedy ^N isle beside a ^N castle . For all that, it
     looked strong and well-built, although, rising out of the marshy mists
     as it did, it had a semblance of insubstantiality about it, as though
     its solid walls hovered above the ground]
     [1199:in a ^N trackless ^N marsh]
     [1200:on a ^N marsh ^N road]
     [1201:at a ^N siegeworks . Despite its present usage, it was all too
     easy to hear the echoes of past
     battles, and ghosts of long-dead knights, which seemed to linger on the air]
     [1202:in the ^N red ^N launds]
     [1203:in the ^N green ^N launds]
     [1204:in the ^N black ^N launds]
     [1205:at a ^N country ^N junction]






     [1206:at a ^N main ^N road]
     [1207:on a ^N country ^N road]
     [1208:on a ^N stone ^N road]
     [1209:on an ^N overgrown ^N road]
     [1210:on an ^N overgrown ^N road]
     [1211:on a ^N hill, beside a ^N tower]
     [1212:on a ^N beach]
     [1213:on a ^N mountaintop . The sense of solitude was all-pervading,
     with any views of the terrain below masked by the damp mists]
     [1214:on a ^N mountainside . Long narrow runs of scree overflowed the
     path in places, and made travelling more of a scramble than riding in
     a straight line]
     [1215:on a ^N glen]
     [1216:in the ^N Orkneys . The settlements were made up of low stout
     crofts, huddled together for shelter from the constant gales. Many had
     not endured the wilder storms and lay open-topped and ruined, either
     deserted or used as makeshift sheep pens]
     [1217:in ^N Scotland . It was a wildly beautiful country, and much
     feared and renowned for the ferocity and hardiness of its inhabitants,
     who would defend their land, infertile and inhospitable as much of it
     was, against any aggressor]
     [1218:in the ^N marches]
     [1219:in an ^N apple ^N
     tree ^N clearing beside ^N castle ^N Chariot] ;;
     [1220:in the lower
     branches of the ^N elm]
     ;
     ;
     [1221:at the top of the ^N elm]

     ; 'echo locations...'
     [1225:in the upper stories of the tower. Finding nothing of interest,
     Lancelot returned to the stairs beside the living quarters]
     [1226:in some thick woodland, and then returned to the path]
     [1227:in King Pellam's castle. He visited King Pellam,
     who told him about the Holy Grail. Then he made his excuses and left]
     [1228:on some more stairs. Lancelot explored some of
     the rest of the castle, then returned to where he started]
     [1229:about to land on the stony rocks, when a sudden gust
     of wind blew the boat back into the water]
     [1230:in Sir Ector's castle. After brief pleasantries, he
     returned outside]
     [1231:right outside theA tower could be seen this side
     of a tidy little village with a dominating castle]
     [1341:shore at the western side of a huge expanse of water]
     [1344:shore beside the isle of Servage]
     [1348:under a daunting, climbable rock cliff. At the top of the
     cliff could be seen a castle worthy of the most horrific of
     horror films]
