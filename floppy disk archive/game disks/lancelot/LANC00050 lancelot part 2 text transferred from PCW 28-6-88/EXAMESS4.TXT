     [601:a brave and fearless knight. He had an interesting face, with a
     strong nose and jaw, which gave him a proud and noble expression,
     although he looked older than his years. Of medium height, he was
     stockily built, with broad shoulders. His armour was new and still
     didn't quite look as though it had 'settled' on him.] ; Lancelot.

     [602:Tristram, who had fair silky hair and a slightly foppish manner.
     He was famous throughout the land for his accomplishments on the harp,
     the which you could see borne on his slight shoulders. He was nimble
     and agile in combat, which made up for his lack of brute force] ; Tristram.
     [603:Galahad. The sun seemed to shine all around Galahad, of the
     golden hair, sunny smile and cornflower blue eyes. His debonair,
     carefree manner suggested that little was ever likely to go wrong in Galahad's
     life. His armour gleamed, even on the dullest day, his horse was the
     sleekest and fleetest of them all, he was truly everything a dashing young
     knight should be. And he knew it.  ] ; Galahad.
     [604:Bors de Ganis, a steady and reliable knight whom you could
     usually count on. He was one of the longest-standing of the Round
     Table, and embodied all its values of chivalry and valour] ; Bors de Ganis.
     [605:a knight with a large question mark tattooed on his head, jovial
     and hearty] ; Mark.
     [606:Ga of Sir Meliot. Lacerated from scalp to
     foot with deep, gaping wounds from spear and sword, it was difficult
     to imagine how he had looked whole] ; Meliot.

     [609:Lamorak, small and wiry, with an aggressive demeanour ] ; Lamorak.

     [610:Ector de Maris, the brother of Lancelot, a faithful, competent
     knight whose love for his brother kept him blindly loyal, and brave in
     his shadow] ; Ector.
     [611:Agravain, brother of Gawain, who had pointed features, and sharp
     fer of Sir Meliot. Lacerated from scalp to
     foot with deep, gaping wounds from spear and sword, it was difficult
     to imagine how he had looked whole] ; Meliot.

     [609:Lamorak, small and wiry, with an aggressive demeanour ] ; Lamorak.

     [610:Ector de Maris, the brother of Lancelot, a faithful, competent
     knight whose love for his brother kept him blindly loyal, and brave in
     his shadow] ; Ector.
     [611:Agravain, brother of Gawain, who had pointed features, and sharp
     ferret-like nose] ; Agravain.
     [612:Aliduke. He was tall and powerful, of burly build, and his armour
     was riddled with nicks and dents from fierce battles ] ; Aliduke.
     [613:Brandiles, who was, as usual, scratching himself. he had a
     crooked face, accentuated by a broken nose.] ; Brandiles.

     [614:Brian, a roaring giant of a man, with a thick ginger beard and
     long luxuriant locks of golden bronze] ; Brian.
     [615:Geheris, who was dark like his brother, Gawain, short in stature,
     but powerfully built] ; Geheris.
     [616:Gareth. Unlike his brothers GAwain, Geheris and Agravain, he was
     tall, broad and fair, with huge strong hands which looked as though
     they could crush rocks without difficulty] ; Gareth.
     [617:Lionel, a very young knight, who was Lancelot's nephew. He looked
     and fiddled with his wristlets, chewing at his lower lip the
     meanwhile. His fingernails were bitten down to the quick] ; Lionel.
     [618:Marhaus, who was older than many of the other knights, and bore
     many scars of battles on his face and arms] ; Marhaus.
     [619:a knight of particularly evil appearance, with hooded brows and a






     single straight line where two distinct eyebrows should have been, and
     a gnarled chin which jutted alarmingly from his face. He had perhaps
     been  spoiled by the many treacherous deeds and battles in his past] ;
     Sir Breunis.

     [620:invisible. Lancelot could hear his pattering feet
     running around, but could see nothing of him] ; Invisible Garlon.

     aura] ; magic knight in Perilous Bedroom.
     [623:Turquin, hard-faced knight with little expression in his granite-
     like features. Even his eyes seemed glassy and to betray little of
     what he was thinking. His fast agile movements, however, belied a
     quick intelligence and cunning] ; Turquin.
     [624:wearing about half the armour in the kingdom. A full set of half-
     inch mail was merely the outer layer - inside were layers of mail
     and leathers. His horse could obviously hardly cope with the weight -
     and Pedivere was swaying from side to side on top] ; Pedivere.
     [625:the Black Knight. He looked as though he was made out of solid
     stone, so thick were his limbs. His armour shone like ebony  ] ; Black Knight.
     [626:the Green Knight. If anything, he was taller and even more
     powerful than the Black Knight, and the veins stood out starkly on his
     temples and his hands. The green colouring, of his armour and also his
     horse, made it difficult to see him clearly from a distance] ; Green Knight.

     ;
     ;

     size of a outhouse. With his flowing flame coloured hair, he looked as
     though his very head was on fire] ; Red Knight.
     [628:Hellawes, a sorceress able to take on many forms. In her natural
     state, she was evidentally not in her first youth, but still carried
     herself rigidly upright, her long stright black hair splashed with
     grey, and piercing jet-coloured eyes that seemed to see straight into
     your mind] ; Hellawes the Witch.
     [629:Queen Morgan. She was a tall, angularly thin woman, with a long
     sharp nose, and dark, dramatically etched features. Her talon-like pointed
     fingernails and long narrow feet accentuated this. Her beauty was cold
     and almost cruel, but always fascinating ] ; Q. Morgan.
     [630:Queen Northgales, tall, blonde and statuesque, with a commanding
     face when it was in repose. However, when she smiled, she blossomed
     and looked almost coy] ; Q. Northgales.
     [631:Queen Eastlands, petite and dark, with impish features and dark eyes
     like deep pools, mysterious and alluring] ; Q. Eastlands.
     [632:Queen Outisles, whose flame-coloured hair belied her reputation
     for a fiery temper when aroused to anger. Her piercing green eyes had

     and kept looking from the tree to the castle behind her] ; Lady.
     [637:about 8 feet tall, thickly built and looking immensely

     wide blue eyes] ; Elaine.

     pointing inwards could be seen protruding from a cavernous jaw] ; fiendly dragon.

     tree] ; hawk, tangled in tree.
     [651:a large dog, standing about waist height to Lancelot. He had a

     legs] ; brachet.
