     [803:in the ^N lower ^N prison. It was gloomily dark, and the ^N walls
     felt slimy with damp. The heavy ^N air smelt like a stagnant ^N pond]
     [804:in the ^N courtyard, a stone-flagged ^N square. It had evidentally
     been recently weeded, since the ^N soil between the ^N stones was loose and
     newly turned ]
     [805:in a ^N secret ^N passage. It was very dark, and so narrow that
     you would need to squeeze your ^N way through the jagged ^N rock in places.
     The uneven ^N floor needed careful negotiation, although a few rough
     ^N steps had been cut into the ^N ground to cope with sharp ^N descents and
     ^N hills]
     [806:in the ^N entrance, under a wide ^N arch of ^N stone encrusted with
     ^N flints. The embellishment of a human ^N skull nailed to the ^N centre of the
     ^N arch was not a particularly welcoming ^N touch]
     [807:in a ^N gateway. The ^N gates, massive ^N structures of solid wrought
     ^N iron, were flung back]
     [808:in a ^N cell. The ^N ceiling was so low that ^N Lancelot could
     barely stand up straight, and ^N puddles of ^N moisture had collected
     in the ^N dips in the uneven ^N floor]

     [809:in a ^N prison ^N corridor, a narrow winding ^N passageway, which
     led uphill and downwards in disorientating ^N turns]
     [810:in a ^N cell, a long narrow ^N room, with a rough ^N pile of ^N straw in
     one ^N corner. A tiny ^N grille set into the high ^N ceiling let in a little
     ^N light, but nothing could be seen through it, and it was way out of
     reach]
     [812:in a ^N prison, a ^N passageway from which a ^N number of heavy wooden
     ^N doors led into the ^N cells. Every ^N sound echoed around the stone
     ^N chambers. It was so cold that ^N Lancelot could see his
     own ^N breath]
     [813:on ^N deck, standing high above the surging ^N waters below. The
     whole ^N ship creaked in the ^N wind, and some of the ^N planks which made up
     the ^N deck seemed to shake]
     [814:in a ^N castle. The ^N rooms were much higher than in most ^N castles
     ^N Lancelot
     knew, the ^N ceilings almost out of sight. The ^N walls were built from a
     dark charcoal-grey ^N stone, and looked thick enough to withstand any
     ^N onslaught]
     [815:in a ^N prison. The individual ^N cells appeared to have been adapted from
     ^N caves which had always existed on the ^N site, rather than being built
     specifically. The earth ^N floor was alternately rock hard and sludgy
     with dampness, while cramped ^N passages led off to the ^N cells]
     [816:on some ^N stairs, rickety with age and with many ^N steps missing.
     Wooden ^N slats had obviously been placed on the stone ^N ledges at some
     point, but many of these had rotted or worn away]
     [817:in a room with a ^N bath, a small ^N chamber with a roaring ^N fire at
     the far end. ^N Cauldrons of steaming ^N water hung over the ^N fireplace, and






     a number of large ^N towels were placed on a ^N shelf to one side of the
     ^N hearth, warming with the ^N heat of the ^N fire]
     [818:in a ^N hall, a wide ^N room lit by ^N torches in ornate ^N holders fixed
     to the ^N walls. ^N Trophies from ^N hunting and ^N battles hung everywhere, from
     complete ^N suits of ^N armour to stuffed ^N animals' ^N heads]
     [819:on some ^N stairs. The spiral ^N staircase wound tightly around the
     ^N contours of the ^N tower, while the occasional slit ^N windows afforded a
     fine ^N view of the ^N shoreline]
     [820:in the ^N perilous ^N bedroom. It was very dark, but a large ^N bed
     with a plump ^N mattress and a ^N washstand could just be perceived in the
     ^N gloom]
     [821:in the lower branches of the ^N elm, broad and solid and slightly
     mossy. Parting the ^N greenery of the young ^N sprigs revealed the ^N tree
     continuing to stretch upwards to the ^N sky]
     [822:in Elaine's ^N bedroom. A soft golden ^N glow from the flickering
     ^N forated ^N altar took up most of the ^N room
     inside]

     [824:in ^N castle ^N Lyonesse|^N dame, a fine imposing ^N edifice in
     smooth pale ^N stone on top of a ^N hill with commanding ^N views of
     the surrounding ^N countryside. Inside, the ^N rooms were light and
     airy, with many interesting ^N pictures and ^N engravings decorating
     the ^N walls, and well-worn comfortable ^N furnishings]

     [825:in a ^N decaying ^N hall. ^N Debris - ^N wood and ^N stones - littered the
  orated ^N altar took up most of the ^N room
     inside]

     [824:in ^N castle ^N Lyonesse|^N dame, a fine imposing ^N edifice in
     smooth pale ^N stone on top of a ^N hill with commanding ^N views of
     the surrounding ^N countryside. Inside, the ^N rooms were light and
     airy, with many interesting ^N pictures and ^N engravings decorating
     the ^N walls, and well-worn comfortable ^N furnishings]

     [825:in a ^N decaying ^N hall. ^N Debris - ^N wood and ^N stones - littered the
     ^N floor and the ^N walls were covered in ^N lichens. A couple of small
     ^N bushes
     had taken root in one of the many ^N cracks in the stone ^N floor]
     [826:in the entrance to ^N chapel ^N perilous. It was a narrow
     ^N passage, with ^N plants overhanging the ^N doorway, creating a green
     ^N light
     which shone into the ^N chapel beyond, much of which seemed to be swathed in
     ^N shadows]
     [827:inside the ^N chapel. Dark wooden ^N pillars supported the ^N rafters,
     and thick ^N cobwebs draped many of the ^N statuettes which rested against
     the ^N walls]
     [828:in the ^N inner ^N chamber, a small cramped ^N room, with many
     strange ^N ornaments and ^N relics lining the ^N walls and crowding the
     ^N floor]
     [829:at the top of the ^N elm. The ^N branches were much slimmer here and
     were full of ^N sap, with many small ^N shoots bursting from the ^N tips of the
     ^N sprigs. The ^N wind could be felt much more strongly here and the whole
     ^N tree seemed to
     sway in the ^N breeze]
     ;
     [830:on the ^N stairs. Here the stone ^N steps gave way to a wooden
     ^N construction, which creaked disconcertingly underfoot]
     [831:in the ^N living ^N quarters. The ^N furniture looked old and well-
     used. A few ^N drapes hung from the ^N ceiling, but were quite powerless to
     eliminate the ^N draughts which swirled through the ^N rooms]
     [832:on the ^N stairs, a broad sweeping ^N staircase hewn out of solid
     ^N stone]
     [833:in a ^N stable, heaped high with ^N straw, and also, since it had






     evidentally not been recently mucked out, ^N piles of ^N horse ^N excrement.
     Brass ^N rings for tethering the ^N horses lined the ^N wall]
     [834:on the ^N stairs, which wound upwards steeply and unevenly in tight
     circles]
     [835:in the ^N basement, which smelt musty and stale. A few ^N casks of
     some unidentifiable ^N drink distilled at the ^N castle nestled against the
     ^N wall. The ^N floor was slightly damp and the ^N ceiling low]
     [836:in a ^N tunnel, cut through sandy ^N earth and weaving around the
     makeshift ^N walls of solid ^N rock. Its ^N height varied wildly from one
     ^N stretch to the next; much of the going had to be made on ^N hands and
     ^N knees. Occasionally the ^N noise of dripping ^N water signalled that the
     ^N roof was not stable throughout the ^N tunnel, although a few wooden
     ^N props had been driven into the soft ^N soil for support ]

     [837:in a ^N prison, a solid stone ^N outhouse, with few ^N windows and an
     earth ^N floor]
     [838:in a ^N guardroom, entirely unfurnished apart from a ^N couple of
     wooden ^N benches and a low ^N table. ^N Tankards, some empty, some half-filled
     with ^N ale cluttered the ^N table and the high ^N window ^N ledge at the far end]
     [839:in an ^N upper ^N prison. Here one could see out of the tiny
     barred ^N windows and look down at the sheer drop of several hundred feet
     to the rocky ^N ground below]

     [845:on a ^N riverbank, a grassy ^N stretch bordered by tall coarse ^N reeds
     and the ^N mud of the ^N river's ^N edge itself]
     [846:on a ^N decrepit ^N bridge, which was sodden through and through
     and many of its ^N planks were splintered, or gaping with ^N holes, so that
     the ^N water below was clearly visible]
     [847:outside a ^N manor ^N house. It was taller than most of the
     nearby ^N buildings, made of grey ^N stone, with many high narrow ^N windows.
     ^N Smoke curled up from a central ^N chimney set into the thick ^N thatch]
     [848:in ^N forest ^N Meliot. The dense ^N growth of tall ^N conifers,
     soaring straight up to the ^N sky like
     ^N spires, cut out the ^N sunlight from the ^N forest ^N floor. The ^N ground was
     soft with a ^N carpet of ^N pine ^N needles and spotted with ^N fir ^N cones ]
     [849:on a ^N dangerous ^N road, twisting and winding around ^N boulders,
     and ^N clumps of ^N eaves and ^N leaf ^N mould]
     [852:on a ^N roman ^N road beside a ^N turret. The long straight
     ^N highway stretched out as far as the ^N eye could see and had been laid
     with flat ^N stones, although ^N weeds had sprouted plentifully in the
     ^N cracks. The ^N turret threw a long dark ^N shadow across the ^N way]
     [853:at a ^N junction in the ^N forest. The ^N track divided into two
     here, both ^N paths of well-trodden rotting ^N leaves, although the higher
     ^N road looked eaves and ^N leaf ^N mould]
     [852:on a ^N roman ^N road beside a ^N turret. The long straight
     ^N highway stretched out as far as the ^N eye could see and had been laid
     with flat ^N stones, although ^N weeds had sprouted plentifully in the
     ^N cracks. The ^N turret threw a long dark ^N shadow across the ^N way]
     [853:at a ^N junction in the ^N forest. The ^N track divided into two
     here, both ^N paths of well-trodden rotting ^N leaves, although the higher
     ^N road looked slightly drier underfoot]
     [854:in ^N Garlon's ^N turret, a squat square ^N tower built with many
     small ^N stones wedged together]
     [855:at a ^N big ^N clearing beside the ^N castle of ^N forest ^N
     Sauvage. The cool dusk of the ^N forest gave way to sunny ^N grassland, a
     small ^N meadow sprinkled with ^N buttercups and ^N cowslips, and humming with
     ^N bees and other ^N insects]
     [856:on a ^N roman ^N road through ^N briars. The tangled ^N thorns






     stretched out over the ^N road to catch the unwary. Some faded and blowsy
     ^N flowers were still left on the ^N plants, which were thronged with lazy
     ^N bees buzzing from one to the other. The ^N road wove its ^N way through the
     ^N bushes as far as the ^N horizon]
     [857:on a ^N roman road through ^N forest ^N Sauvage, a straight wide
     ^N track stretching deep into the ^N forest. Some paving ^N stones had been
     laid to cover the most obviously muddy ^N parts. The surrounding ^N trees
     curved over the ^N road to create a high ^N arch]
     [858:on the ^N great north road, wide and even as it traversed the
     ^N moors or followed alongside ^N rivers but narrowing to a stony single-
     file ^N track as it wound around ^N hills, or descended into wooded ^N valleys.
     Some ^N parts, where the ^N track was stamped into a hard smooth ^N surface by
     ^N carts and ^N horses' ^N hooves and the ^N roadside was dotted with
     ^N cairns, were
     well-used by ^N travellers, while other ^N sections, where fewer ^N people used
     the ^N road, were more difficult to negotiate]

     [859:on a ^N triumphal ^N avenue|^N Camelot ^N Arthur ^N Guenever, an
     imposing ^N highway, fully lined with flat ^N stones, dry and kept clear of
     ^N weeds and encroaching ^N undergrowth]
     [860:on the ^N coast road, a sandy ^N strip just a few ^N feet above the
     ^N high ^N tide ^N mark. Stubby ^N marram ^N grass and other ^N sea ^N plants lined the
     ^N verges, while empty ^N seashells littered the ^N way, and ^N flotsam from the
     ^N winter ^N storms lay piled up on the ^N sides]
     [861:at ^N Tintagel, the ^N headland jutting out fiercely into the
     foaming ^N Atlantic below. At the very ^N top of the sheer ^N cliff rose the
     dark grey ^N castle, its ^N battlements affording a fine ^N view over towards
     ^N Wales
     across the ^N sea and the north Cornish ^N hinterland to the south]
     [862:on a ^N walled ^N road, over which a ^N man on ^N horseback could just
     see into the ^N fields beyond. The ^N dry ^N stone ^N wall was speckled with
     ^N lichens and small ^N plants wedged into its ^N crevices]
     [863:on a ^N road, marked out with smooth ^N pebbles imported from a
     nearby ^N beach, which crunched underfoot]
     [864:on a ^N beach, where occasional
     ^N crops of dark grey ^N rock pushed out above the fine golden ^N sands, leaving
     deep ^N rock ^N pools at their ^N feet. It was bordered on either ^N side by tall
     ^N headlands protruding into the ^N bay]
     ;
     [866:on a ^N hill, a windswept ^N tor covered in short coarse ^N grass, the
     ^N peak a bare ^N head of hard ^N granite. The ^N slopes were dotted with smaller
     ^N granite ^N outcrops, and mazy ^N rabbit ^N tracks wove from ^N rock to
     ^N rock]
     [867:on a ^N winding ^N road, which negotiated thickly wooded ^N river
     ^N valleys and wound around the ^N foot of bleak ^N moors, sometimes following
     the ^N course of ^N ridges on their lower ^N slopes. ^N Dry ^N stone
     ^N walls marked the
     ^N verges along some ^N sections, while the ^N way meandered alongside small
     twisting ^N streams for long ^N stretches]
     [868:at a ^N crossroads, a large and evidentally busy ^N junction, since
     the ^N track was worn and pitted with ^N footmarks and ^N clefts made by
     ^N horses' ^N hooves. A small ^N patch of straggling ^N grass marked the
     ^N centre of
     the ^N crossing]
     [869:on an ^N island, a hugs built on to solid ^N rock a hundred ^N yards or so back from
     the ^N sea itself, a tall square ^N edifice looking out to ^N sea]
     [871:in ^N Corbin ^N village, a ^N settlement of tiny stone ^N houses, built
     in ^N places to afford as much ^N protection from the ^N wind as possible,
     their ^N doors facing inland, and ^N smoke blowing furiously from nearly all
     the ^N chimneys. A few meagre ^N strips of farmed ^N land could be
     seen behind the ^N cottages, but there was little s built on to solid ^N rock a hundred ^N yards or so back from
     the ^N sea itself, a tall square ^N edifice looking out to ^N sea]
     [871:in ^N Corbin ^N village, a ^N settlement of tiny stone ^N houses, built
     in ^N places to afford as much ^N protection from the ^N wind as possible,
     their ^N doors facing inland, and ^N smoke blowing furiously from nearly all
     the ^N chimneys. A few meagre ^N strips of farmed ^N land could be
     seen behind the ^N cottages, but there was little sign of any ^N inhabitants]
     [872:in a ^N forest ^N maze. The ^N trees grew so close together and the
     smaller ^N branches were so dense it was impossible to see more than few
     ^N yards ahead]

     [873:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [874:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [875:in a ^N forest ^N maze. A green ^N light seemed to shine thinly from
     the ^N sky over the ^N trees and ^N forest ^N floor]

     [876:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [877:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [878:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [879:in a ^N forest ^N maze. ^N Twigs snapped underfoot, and the ^N crackle
     was muffled in the thick ^N greenery which hung like a ^N curtain on all
     ^N sides]
     [880:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [881:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [882:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [883:in a ^N forest ^N maze. A ^N red ^N squirrel jumped casually from one
     ^N branch to another a few ^N yards ahead]
     [884:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [885:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [886:at the ^N wailing ^N castle, which loomed out of the ^N woods, first
     indistinctly, as the ^N trees hid it from clear ^N view. It might have been
     like something out of a ^N fairy ^N tale, had it not been for the stark ash
     grey ^N contours of the ^N towers, and its utter lack of ^N adornment. There
     was also nothing enchanted about the ^N sounds of pitiful ^N cries, which
     must surely be human, which could be heard indistinctly from the
     inside of the ^N castle]
     [887:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [888:in a ^N forest ^N maze. The ^N sky had disappeared from ^N view,
     blocked by the ^N closeness of the ^N trees]
     [889:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [890:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [891:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [892:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [893:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [894:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [895:in a ^N forest ^N maze. ^N Twigs and ^N branches rustled and unseen
     ^N birds
     set up a great ^N crying as a ^N wild ^Nanimal searched for ^N food somewhere in
     the ^N distance]
     [896:in a ^N forest ^N maze]
     [897:on a ^N forest ^N road. Surrounded on both ^N sides by dense
     ^N greenery, a peaty ^N track cut through the ^N woods]
     [898:on a ^N reedy ^N isle beside a ^N castle. The ^N ground squelched
     and slurped underfoot, and the coarse ^N reed ^N beds were populated by
     ^N flocks of wailing ^N water ^N birds. The ^N island was low and flat above the
     watery ^N swamps around it, and ^N castle was built into the only ^N outcrop of
     solid ^N rock on the small ^N bump of ^N land]
     [899:in a ^N trackless ^N marsh. Oily stagnant ^N pools gave way to brown






     shifting ^N mud, with occasional ^N tufts of ^N grasses attempting to gain some
     ^N foothold in this slippery oozing ^N landscape. The ^N ground was
     completely flat for as far as the ^N eye could see, and a grey ^N mist hung
     over the clammy ^N ground]
     [900:on a ^N marsh ^N road. Raised above the level of the brackish
     ^N mud ^N flats, the ^N track had been laid with ^N pebbles to mark out the drier
     ^N ground, but was nevertheless very wet underfoot]
     [901:at a ^N siegeworks. The ^N trenches and defensive ^N mounds were clearly
     visible, the ^N trenches deep and wide to allow the ^N accommodation of
     horsed ^N knights as well as ^N foot ^N soldiers. Here and there the remains of
     ^N battle
     could be seen - half a ^N sword, or a broken ^N spear, or a scrap of torn
     ^N chain
     ^N mail hanging from a ^N tree]
     [902:in the ^N red ^N launds, bare and baked of ^N earth. The barren
     sandy ^N ground yielded only a few sparse ^N tufts of ^N grass in the way of
     vegetation. The small ^N mounds which served as ^N hills in the ^N vicinity
     were as bare as the ^N vales, which gave the ^N lands the appearance of a
     ^N desert]
     [903:in the ^N green ^N launds. Here the ^N fields were lush and bushy
     with tall vibrant ^N grasses and small ^N shrubs,  in the ^N soil. What ^N trees there were were stunted and thin, with
     shrivelled ^N leaves and spindly ^N twigs for branches]
     [905:at a ^N country ^N junction. Despite it being a major ^N meeting of
     the ^N roads, it was evidentally not well-travelled. ^N Grass grew across
     all the ^N tracks, and wild ^N hawthorn ^N trees overhung the ^N crossing, having
     not been cut back to make the ^N junction clearer or wider, either
     deliberately or through any sustained ^N traffic]
    in the ^N soil. What ^N trees there were were stunted and thin, with
     shrivelled ^N leaves and spindly ^N twigs for branches]
     [905:at a ^N country ^N junction. Despite it being a major ^N meeting of
     the ^N roads, it was evidentally not well-travelled. ^N Grass grew across
     all the ^N tracks, and wild ^N hawthorn ^N trees overhung the ^N crossing, having
     not been cut back to make the ^N junction clearer or wider, either
     deliberately or through any sustained ^N traffic]
     [906:at a ^N main ^N road, a wide smooth ^N highway, lined at regular
     ^N intervals with broad ^N elm ^N trees, which gave it the appearance of a regal
     ^N avenue]
     [907:on a ^N country ^N road, with ^N dry ^N stone ^N walls lining the
     ^N route.
     Against the ^N walls grew ^N blackberry ^N bushes, which made even the
     negotiable part of the ^N road quite narrow and difficult in places]
     [908:on a ^N stone ^N road, paved with large ^N flagstones to make the
     going as even and steady as possible. ^N Mosses and small ^N ferns
     grew in the ^N gaps in the ^N stones, and spread up the squat ^N walls which
     marked the ^N verges of the ^N road]
     [909:on an ^N overgrown ^N road. It was difficult to see the exact
     ^N path, so tangled and knotted were the ^N bushes and creeping
     ^N plants which encroached on either ^N side]
     [910:on an ^N overgrown ^N road, where outflung ^N branches caught the
     unwary ^N rider across the ^N face, and fallen ^N trees lay across the
     ^N track,
     completely blocking the ^N way. Tall ^N foxgloves grew in the very middle of
     the ^ way, forming a regimental ^N line bisecting the ^N road into two
     ^N lanes]
     [911:on a ^N hill, beside a ^N tower. The ^N slopes were bare and craggy,
     the ^N rocks showing through the straggling ^N tufts of ^N grass and ground
     ^N plants. A cold ^N wind blew from the north from which little ^N shelter
     could be found, and echoed round the ^N tower, which had a battered
     appearance, as though it had barely withstood some of the harsher






     winter ^N gales]
     [912:on a ^N beach, a small ^N bay forming a deep ^N curve between two
     jagged ^N headlands. Seaweed covered ^N rocks were strewn all over the
     ^N strand, with deep ^N rock and sand ^N pools which made the going tricky]
     [913:on a ^N mountaintop, up in the midst of grey swirling ^N clouds. the
     ^N vegetation had ceased altogether here, and the ^N ground was bare lichen-
     covered ^N rock, which had been worn smooth by the ^N winds and ^N rain on the
     exposed ^N side]
     [914:on a ^N mountainside, on a steep stony ^N path near a gurgling
     ^N stream. The ^N path wove around the more accessible ^N ridges of the
     ^N mountain, finally twisting out of sight into the ^N clouds which
     enshrouded the ^N summit]
     [915:in a ^N glen, which sloped down through ^N woods and ^N glades to a
     narrow ^N beck in the ^N foot of the ^N valley. Above the tree line, the
     ^N ground
     was covered with ^N heather and ^N gorse ^N bushes forming a colourful
     ^N patchowrk of purple and yellow on the ^N hillsides]
     [916:in the ^N Orkneys, dozens of ^N islands, some like small ^N rocks
     hurled at random into the ^N sea. The larger, inhabited ^N islands were bare
     and windswept, with short thick ^N grass interspersed with stunted ^N trees,
     blown sideways from the ^N roots by the prevailing ^N winds. A few hardy
     ^N sheep, protected from the ^N gales by their luxuriant wool
     ^N coats, grazed on the sparse ^N ground, apparently impervious to the
     ^N elements]

     [917:in ^N Scotland, a land of fertile broadleaved ^N woods and lush
     ^N pasture in the south, yielding to the majesty of imposing ^N peaks and
     deep narrow ^N lochs in the north, the ^N valleys covered in dark secretive
     ^N pine
     ^N forests, the gentle lower ^N slopes of the ^N hills carpeted with springy
     ^N heather and the bright yellow of ^N gorse. Occasionally small rough stone
     ^N dwellings and untidy ^N villages could be seen where the ^N terrain
     allowed for ^N habitation]
     [918:in the ^N marches, a bleak ^N no-man's ^N land of the oft-disputed
     ^N borders between ^N Scotland and the ^N realm of ^N Logris. The ^N area was criss-
     crossed with ^N walls built to mark the ^N ownership of the ^N lands they
     separated. Some had obviously been fought over, won and lost long
     before, since td ^N boughs
     gave a firm steady ^N foothold]
     ;; [921:at the top of the ^N elm. The smaller ^N branches swayed in the
     ^N breeze. The ^N sprigs were full of ^N sap and numerous plump ^N shoots swelled
     in the ^N warmth of the ^N sun]

     ; 'echo locations...'
     [925:in the upper stories of the tower. The rooms, two to each storey,
     were scarcely furnished at all. In some, there was only a few emoty
     sacks laid against a wall or a couple of wooden stools. A few moth-
  d ^N boughs
     gave a firm steady ^N foothold]

     were scarcely furnished at all. In some, there was only a few emoty
     sacks laid against a wall or a couple of wooden stools. A few moth-
     eaten drapes covered some of the draughtier walls. Finding nothing of interest,
     Lancelot returned to the stairs beside the living quarters]
     [926:in some thick woodland. He could not see the way ahead so thick
     were the bushes and greenery and tripped constantly over creeping
     plants and tree roots. Finding no semblance of a track through the
     undergrowth, he then returned to the path]






     [927:in King Pellam's castle. King Pellam himself came out to greet
     Lancelot, and after the customary pleasantries, settled him down with
     a jug of ale to talk seriously. The King, it soon transpired, wished
     to discuss with Lancelot the nature of the Holy Grail, the sacred
     vessel from which Jesus Christ had drunk and which had been brought to
     the realm by Joseph of Arimathea.% % Soon, the King assured Lancelot,
     it would appear, briefly and magically, to the knights at Camelot, but
     only when the time was right and a knight pure enough in heart to
     achieve its blessing was present.% %King Pellam seemed to be compelled
     to reveal to Lancelot many of the details of the quest for the Grail
     which the Knights of the Round Table would undertake in the name of
     King Arthur and the kingdom of Logris. Lancelot heardPellam reiterate
     that only the noblest and most honourable of the knights would
     eventually achieve the quest, although many would try and lose their
     lives in the attempt, and he felt his heart stir at the challenge
     which he hoped lay ahead of him. The king went on, drawing imaginary
     maps on the table top with his fingers to show how far and wide the
     knights would travel on their quests, both individually and together.%
     % Lancelot listened intently at first. He knew full well of the
     Grail's legend and that the highest honour he, or any other knight,
     could attain would be to seek and find the Grail, and be cleansed and
     purified by it. He had hoped that the King might tell him more than he
     knew already and perhaps give him some clues about his own chances of
     success in the quest.% % But King Pellam did not, and so, after some
     hours, when the jug of ale was empty, he made his excuses and left]

     [928:on some more stairs. Lancelot explored some of
     the rest of the castle, but found little of interest. Many of the
     rooms appeared to be disused, and a number of the doors were locked.
     After casting a cursory glance over some of the more interesting
     pictures and relics on the walls, he returned to where he started]
     [929:about to land on the stony rocks, and he made ready to jump ship
     in the hope of finding a foothold at the foot of cliff before the boat
     was dashed to pieces, when a sudden gust
     of wind blew the boat back into the water]
     [930:in Sir Ector's castle. He greeted his brother warmly and they
     talked of his deeds and the latest news from Camelot. After a while,
     the conversation lagged, and he
     returned outside]
     [931:right outside the castle, but after completing a circuit of the
     four square walls, he could find no way in, so
     he returned to the road]
     ;
     [1033:on a lake. The water was glassily still, and so deep as to be a
     rich blue-black in colour]
     [1034:on a lake beside a rock]
     [1035:on a lake]
     [1036:on a lake]
     [1037:on a lake]
     [1038:on a lake]
     [1039:on a lake]
     [1040:on a lake. A small breeze whipped up the surface of the water
     into tiny foam-capped waves]

     [1042:on a lake]
     [1043:on a lake]
     [1044:on a lake. In the distance, a couple of large water birds
     screeched in to make a splashy landing near the far shore]
