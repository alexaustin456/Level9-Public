; MESSAGE.TXT, messages/keywords for the game.
;
; ST version
;
; Messages are of the form: [ number : text ] ; comment
; They must be in numeric order, but gaps are allowed in the number
; sequence, of course.
;
; | (vertical bar) terminates the printable part of a message. It
;   is typed by shifting backslash (to the left of the keyboard).
; / forces the following character to be printed literally.
; % is carriage return. Note that carriage return is ignored if
;   the printing is already at the start of a line, to make coding
;   simpler. To force a real carriage return, print space first.
; ^ (shift 6) marks a word for recognition by the parser. It is
;   followed by a letter for word type:
;   Adjective; Comment; conJunction; Noun; Preposition; Verb.
;
; Capitalization is done automatically on output and you are
; recommended to use lower case for the first letter of messages
; as this improves compression and will make no difference on
; output, providing all punctuation is correct.

[601:a brave and chivalrous knight. His face was not comely, yet
it was so full of strength and nobility that it was ever a
welcome sight. He was a large man, and bore his heavy armomur
with an easy grace] ; Lancelot
;
[602:a fair-faced and richly dressed young fellow. Though
valorous in combat and not without skill in the joust, yet he did
prefer the pleasures of the court, and his skill upon the harp
was renowned throughout the land] ; Tristram
;
[603:a handsome and well-set young knight, but with an air that
brooked no easy comradeship. It was not that he was aloof, but
rather that he lived upon a different level of purity and purpose
that ordinary mortals] ; ;Galahad
;
[604:solid and reliable. Not quick-witted, but deep thinking
nontheless] ; Sir Bors de Ganis
;
[605:a cantankerous old fellow, bluff and hearty] ; Sir Question Mark

[606:a red-headed knight from the Orkneys, with the high
complexion and flashing eyes that betokened a hot temper. He was
deeply loyal to his friends, but unforgiving to those who did him
wrong] ; Sir Gawain
;
[607:wearing a surcoat of red. Red too were his shield and the
plumes on his helm, and had his helm been removed, then could you
have seen his red hair and beard. He was a huge man, who towered
above his men] ; the Red Knight
;
[608:a small knight who fussed overmuch in matters of
cleanliness] ; Sir Meliot
;
[609:of Wales. He was wiry and small of frame, with a face that
ever bore a scowl] ; Sir Lamorak
;
[610:brother to Sir Lancelot, and one who shared his broad build
and valorous nature] ; Sir Ector de Maris
;
[611:brother to Sir Gawain, but unlike him. Agravain was a thin
dark man with a weasel-like face] ; Sir Agravain
;
[612:a knight of towering strength and proud demeanour who held
himself aloof from his fellows] ; Sir Aliduke
 ;
[613:a lop-sided man, with a broken nose and a tic in one eye.
Whether from fleas or from habit, he seemed to be ever scratching
himself] ; Sir Brandiles
;
[614:a huge man, with legs like tree trunks. His heavy face was
framed by a thick thatch of hair and a long unkempt beard] ; Sir
Brian
;
[615:brother to Sir Gawain, with the same flaming hair and hot
temper] ; Sir Geheris
;
[616:the youngest of the Orkney clan and quite unlike his
brothers. He was fair-haired and fair-skinned, with soft,
delicate hands] ; Sir Gareth
;
[617:the young nephew of Lancelot; a nervous youth, whose
fingernails were bitten to the quick] ; Sir Lionel
;
[618:an older knight with a lined face which told of many
battles fought and not all of them won] ; Sir Marhaus
;
[652:a motley lot, their hands and faces thick with the grime of
the farmyard, and a strong smell of the stables about them. Some
muttered to each other with surly, downcast eyes, while others
stared vacantly into the distance] ; peasants
;
[653:gathered to watch the execution. A dirty, ill-dressed mob,
they waited with malicious pleasure to see the downfall of one
nobly-born. Though cowed into surly silence, there was yet some
noise as people scuffled for the best positions] ; crowd
;
[654:for certain, not house-trained, nor yet barn-trained, and
nor did they take pride in their grooming] ; hawks above
; Lancelot.
;
[655:holding their spears with lazy grace. They exchanged
pleasantries on the dreadful price of jewelled rings, and tossed
their heads with tinkling laughter] ; Queen's knights
;
[656:a daunting sight, in gleaming black armour, glowering down
from the heights of his jet-black mount] ; Black knight (Arthur
; in disguise).
;
[657:the wife of Arthur. She was tall, and beautiful in a cold,
high-bred manner, with the air of one who would not suffer fools
gladly. The queen wore a gown cut with austere simplicity, which
could not mask the fineness of the material, nor her comely
figure and elegant stance. Her wimple was of exceptional height,
and beneath it her heavy golden tresses could be seen, coiled
into a simple knot] ; Guenever, Lancelot's love etc.
;
[658:a thin man and slightly built for a a knight. He had an
arrogant face, and was much given to ordering people about,
particularly those who were noticeably more proficient than him
in a joust. Because he was the foster-brother of the king, he was
often able to escape rebuke for his impertinence] ; Sir Kay
;
[659:a tall thin knight, with a hooked nose and piercing eyes. He
had the habit of staring hard at people, so that many felt ill at
ease in his company] ; Sir Meliagaunt
;
[660:King of England, though he scarce looked the part. He was a
fresh-faced youth, with wide brown eyes, that lit up eagerly at
talk of hunting and honour, but dimmed beneath a serious frown
when matters of policy or administration were being debated. He
thought deeply, if slowly, and strove ever to be a goodly king
and a worthy leader of men] ; Arthur
;
[661:a middle-aged knight, with a worn face much scarred by past
quests and battles. He delighted in recounting endless tales of
noble deeds, in the most which he played the major part] ; Sir
; Colgreavaunce
;
[662:a fusty old wizard of strange garb and manners. He wore a
dark purple robe patterned with swirls that seemed to move of
their own accord and in its many huge pockets he kept all manner
of objects and small animals, such as he might need for his
sorcery. His long, tangled beard was mottled with unnameable
substances, perchance remnants of potions long forgotten. Oftimes
he muttered to himself incomprehensibly, seeming to live in a
world apart from mortal men] ; Merlin
;
[663:a wizened old figure, in turns gloomy and wildly jovial. With
little prompting, he would tell you his rather dismal life story,
before suddenly bursting into song] ; carter
;
[664:slight of figure and vivacious of face. She had a
mischievous smile and a disarming habit of shaking her head when
she laughed] ; Meliagaunt's damosel
;

their uninvited visitor. Lancelot was reluctant to disturb them,
and crept away silently]

[935:in the upstairs rooms of the castle. In the twisting
corridors, he oftimes lost his way for a while. The rooms were
all kept clean and neat, but simply furnished for the court of a
king, and the high ceilings and narrow slit windows made them
cold and draughty. At length he tired of aimless wanderings and
returned to the stairs]

[936:in the downstairs rooms of the castle. The public rooms were
vast and lit by banks of flaming torches, but the back rooms were
altogether smaller, darker, and smellier. Shouted orders, and
snatches of merry banter filtered through some of the heavy oak
doors. At time he would pass servants or messengers, hurrying
through the dim corridors. There was much to see, but little to
do, so he returned to the hall]

spared me. Else there had been all sorts of pother. It was most
honourable of you"]

;; told Lancelot to kneel
;; before him, and when the squire was bent low upon his knees, the king
;; drew out his sword and
;; tapped Lancelot briefly on each shoulder. "Arise, Sir Lancelot",

;; solemnly, and the new knight did so, his face aglow at the honour.
;; Arthur put his sword away and grinned at him.
;; "One of us now, eh?" he said cheerfully ]
;; [2493:told Lancelot to leave. Guenever smiled warmly at
;; Lancelot, and held his gaze for somewhat longer
;; than was needful]
;
[2493:knighted Lancelot, and bade him stay and dine with them. As
they sat at table, and the drinks flowed, Lancelot stole many a
glance at Queen Guenever. Truly, he thought, she was a most
beautiful and stately woman. And as the evening wore on, it came
to him that he was fast losing his heart to her. %At times, their
eyes met and Guenever did look away coyly, like a maiden. At
length, with his heart in his mouth, he essayed to beg of her the
favour of being her champion. As he had feared, she refused for
that she should not be championed by a novice, and for a dreadful
moment Lancelot thought she would rebuff him entirely. %But then
Guenever smiled knowingly at him and bade him to return to her
when he had proved himself to be worthy of her favour. At this,
Lancelot was drunken with pride and joy, and swore he would not
fail, but would go to Logris without delay, there to honour
Guenever with noble deeds and battles chivalrously won. %Then
Arthur looked upon Lancelot and said, "And there are noble deeds
that need to be done. There are sieges yet to be filled at this
Round Table, and knights of which I have heard - all honourable
fellows, the which I need - who are being held captive by rebel
lords who live beyond my rule. Now, could you but bring some of
them to Camelot as free men, that would prove you to be a full
worthy knight, in truth"]

[2499:at this point, you have the option of going straight to the

[2500:they fought for a long time, with neither man giving any
quarter. First one had the upper hand, then the other, and each
soon came to know that his opponent was a valiant knight. They
fought on, trading blow for blow until at last the black knight
yielded. Did Lancelot accept his surrender? ]
[2501:Lancelot brutally smote the defenseless knight, knocking
him to the ground. He leapt down and set to unfastening his helm
with feverish fingers, ready for the fatal blow.% %But, before
Lancelot could strike, dozens of guards came forth from the
bushes and threw him down. Even as Lancelot tried to get up, his
sword was wrenched from his grip and burly men at arms pinned him
down.% %The black knight made himself known as King Arthur, and
chastised Lancelot sorely for his lack of chivalry. The royal
party then rode for Camelot, leaving Lancelot scrabbling for his
weapons in the dirt]
;
[2502:the black knight removed his helm and showed himself to be
King Arthur. "Gramercy, sir, you fought well and chivalrously; in
truth you were a most worthy opponent," he said with a bow, "It
would please me to knight you and to have you join the company of
the Round Table. Come to me tomorrow, at my castle in Camelot."%
%The king summoned his guards from the bushes beyond, where they
had hidden to watch the fight, and the royal party rode for the
city]

he heard the sound of footsteps approaching from within the

;
[2655:knelt to Guenever, "My Queen, forgive me". She paused
briefly and then nodded to Lancelot, who looked for a moment as
though he might ignore her and slay Sir Meliagaunt where he
knelt. The Queen drew herself up to her full height, and insisted
that Lancelot should spare him. Sir Meliagaunt bowed deeply, and
Guenever made it known that she would spend the night at his
castle. As they turned to leave, Guenever whispered in Lancelot's
ear, "Come to me tonight, my saviour"]
;
[2656:waved dismissively and Lancelot felt compelled to leave]

orders to let no-one past this night]

; Sir Meliagaunt...
[2659:was standing over the Queen, his sword poised to strike.
Tense and white with anger, Meliagaunt spat out an accusation of
adultery against the Queen.% %Lancelot, inflamed by his words,
sprang to her defence, and challenged Meliagaunt to a battle for
the Queen's honour. Sir Meliagaunt curled his lip at the young
knight and accepted the challenge, setting the time for three
days thence. Sweeping up his weapons, he called the castle
guards, ordered the window to be secured, and left angrily with
the Queen, clutching her tightly by the arm]
;
[2660:Lancelot heard shouting from the Queen's room]
[2661:the shouting became louder]
[2662:Sir Meliagaunt shouted again, "Whose blood is this"]
[2663:Sir Meliagaunt cried, "If you will not tell me whose blood
this is, then shall you die"]
[2664:Lancelot heard a woman scream in the Queen's room, and he
knew that Guenever was slain]
[2665:the lights went out and the floor gave way, with a great
splintering. Lancelot fell far and smote his head, not waking
until much later]
[2666:promised Lancelot his freedom if he would promise to love
her]
[2667:succumbed to her charms and gave his heart to her, quite
forgetting Guenever. A new horse was found for him and Lancelot
made ready to go]
[2668:the damosel sighed and left]
[2669:a night and a day passed]
[2670:told Lancelot that Guenever was to be executed that day, as
her champion had not appeared to defend her honour. The damosel
saw his grievous suffering and, filled with pity, offered to free
Lancelot in exchange for a kiss]
[2671:kissed the damosel, and she opened the door and left.
A new horse was found, and Lancelot made ready to go]
[2672:the damosel left, and Lancelot knew that Guenever would now die]
[2673:"Just kiss me if you agree"]
;

[2675:Guenever was bound to a stake upon the pyre]
[2676:cried, "Lancelot, defend my honour"]
;
[2677:Meliagaunt was sorely afeared of Lancelot and agreed to
fight only when Lancelot offered to take off half his armour and
have one hand tied behind his back. This was done, and the two
did come to fight.%"This will take but a moment!" called
Meliagaunt, and so it did. For Launcelot taunted Meliagaunt with
his naked side, and when the other did lunge at him, Lancelot
stepped apace and with one mighty blow, clove Meliagaunt in two,
even down to his breastbone.%Thus was the honour of the queen
proven and Guenever freed]
;
[2678:thanked Lancelot for saving her, and was gracious as
befitted her rank, but tears stood in her eyes]
;
[2679:told Arthur what had passed. His face darkened as he heard
the tale of Meligaunt's treachery and cowardice. Then he said
quietly to Lancelot, "Thank you for defending the honour of my
Queen, and ridding us of that wicked knight." But a shadow of
anxiety passed across his face as he spoke, and did not leave him
until some time afterwards]
;
[2680:now all the Knights of the Round Table were assembled, and
life proceeded apace at court. Lancelot lived happily, always
triumphing in the many tournaments that were held, performing
valiant deeds on the hunts, and oftimes taking pleasure in secret
liaisons with Guenever. Full twenty years passed thuswise, until
a prophecy appeared above the one yet empty seat at the Round
Table, the Siege Perilous. This read, FOUR HUNDRED WINTERS AND
FOUR AND FIFTY ACCOMPLISHED AFTER THE PASSION OF OUR LORD JESUS
CHRIST OUGHT THIS SIEGE TO BE FULFILLED. The company knew that
this meant that the fairest, purest knight of all would soon be
revealed to them to lead them in the quest for the Holy Grail.%
%Lancelot laid aside his armour and sword, and set out to take
his leave of the Queen before going forth on his own quest for
the Grail]
;
[2681:there was a knock on the door]
[2682:a voice called out, "Sir Lancelot, come out or we shall be
forced to break down this door". Lancelot knew that he could not
hope to defeat a group of knights with neither sword nor armour]
[2683:the voice called again, "Sir Lancelot, come out and face justice"]
[2684:someone started to beat on the door with a sword hilt]
[2685:the beating became more insistent]
[2686:dozens of knights burst into the room and captured Lancelot]
[2687:opened the door and a knight entered]
[2688:closed the door]
;
[2689:struck down the knight and stripped him of his armour and
weapons. Feverishly, he threw the armour on himself, and
Guenever's nimble fingers saw to the fastenings. Thus armed, he
opened the door and did battle with those knights who stood in
his way, slashing powerfully and deftly to left and to right, his
sword flashing in the dark corridor. Many knights, when they saw
his desperate strength, knew that it would mean death to face
Lancelot in his fury, and vowed to keep their silence about his
presence in the bedchamber of the Queen.% %Others, less wisely,
did give battle, but Lancelot, striving not only for his life but
for his honour and that of the queen, fought with the strength of
ten, and the floor was a bloody heap of bodies after he had done.
% %As Lancelot made to quit the castle, he found a great
commotion in the main hall. The Holy Grail had appeared unto the
knights and all was hubbub and excitement among the company of
the round table. The quest for the Holy Grail was begun]
