[601:a proud and valiant knight. His face was not comely, yet
its strength and nobility made it ever a pleasure to behold.
He was tall and broad of shoulder, and bore his heavy armomur
with an easy grace] ; Lancelot
;
[602:a fair-faced and richly dressed young fellow. His speed and

stature, yet he did prefer the pleasures of the court, and of the
music of his harp] ; Tristram
;
; [603:the son of Lancelot, and a handsome and well-set young
; knight. He was ever triumphant in combat, yet had no vanity and
;took little joy in his worldly successes but did concern himself
; more with the purity of his heart and spirit] ; ;Galahad
;
[604:a stolid, reliable knight, and one of the longest-standing
of the company of the Round Table. Sir Bors embodied all its
values of chivalry and valour] ; Bors de Ganis.
;
[605:another valiant knight] ; Pedivere.
;
[606:a red-headed knight from the Orkneys, with the high
complexion and flashing eyes that betokened a hot temper. He was

;
[612:a knight of towering strength, his body and armour alike
scarred from many fierce battles] ; Aliduke.
;
[613:scratching himself, as was his wont. He was an ill-favoured

a shaggy growth of unkempt hair] ; Brian.
;
[615:brother to Gawain, with the same fiery red hair and brawny

[616:the youngest of the Orkney clan and quite unlike his

both scarred and weary of battles] ; Marhaus.
;

encompassed by a shimmering aura, so bright as almost to hurt
Lancelot's eyes to look upon him] ; magic knight in Perilous

betrayed little of what he thought. Yet was he agile and fast,
and had oftimes shown a cunning intelligence] ; Turquin.
;
[624:, it seemed, wearing near half the armour in the kingdom,
for to keep himself safe from Lancelot. His horse was near to
collapse with the weight and Phelot swaying from side to side in
his saddle] ; Phelot.
;
[625:a daunting sight. He looked to be made of solid stone, so
thick were his limbs, and his armour shone like jet] ; Black
; Knight.
;
[626:a mighty oak of a man, clad all in green on a massive brown
mount. He seemed almost part of the woodland that was his home]
; Green Knight.
;
[627:of medium height, but with a great barrel of a chest, he
perched on a chestnut horse the size of a outhouse. With his
flowing flame coloured hair, he looked as though his very head
was on fire] ; Red Knight.
;
[628:a sorceress able to take on many forms. In her natural

and her jet-black eyes could pierce to your very soul] ; Hellawes
; the Witch.
;

;
[631:petite and dark, with impish features and dark eyes
like deep pools, mysterious and alluring] ; Q. Eastlands.

temper when aroused. Her imperious green eyes had often, it was
said, brought lesser knights and servants to grovelling on their
knees] ; Q. Outisles.
;
[633:furious to be examined like any object. "Prithee keep thy
prying eyes to thyself", she spat] ; Damosel Maledisant.

[634:very pretty. She caught Lancelot's gaze and blushed, then
smiled back, shyly but hopefully] ; damosel warden in Castle Chariot.

;
[925:in the upper stories of the tower. The rooms, two to each
storey, seemed to be chiefly bedchambers. They were sparsely
furnished and contained little to tell Lancelot about the people
that used them, save that they must be a hardy breed. The rooms
were cold and draughty, the beds little more than piles of skins
and coarse cloths. Finding nothing to help him, Lancelot returned
to the stairs beside the living quarters]
;
[926:in some thick woodland. He could not see the way ahead, so
thick were the bushes and greenery, and oft he tripped over
creeping plants and tree roots. Finding no semblance of a track
through the thick of it, he returned to the path]
;
[927:in Castle Pellam. King Pellam himself came forth to welcome
Lancelot, and when greetings were done, settled him down with a
jug of ale to talk at length. The King, it did seem wished to
speak to Lancelot of the nature of the Holy Grail, the sacred
vessel from which Jesus Christ had drunk and which had been
brought to the realm by Joseph of Arimathea.%

%Soon, the King confided, it would appear, but briefly, to the
knights at Camelot. Yet this would only be when the time was
right and in the presence of a knight full pure of heart and fit
to receive its blessing.%

%King Pellam seemed compelled to tell of all the many of the
details of the quest for the Grail which the Knights of the Round
Table would undertake. And Lancelot heard his say, ever and
again, that only the purest and best of the knights would ever
attain the Grail, though many would try and lose their lives in
the attempt. Lancelot felt his heart stir at the challenge which
lay ahead of him, and he listened hard as The king went on,
drawing maps on the table top with his fingers to show how far
and wide the knights would travel on their quests.%

%Lancelot had heard tell of the Grail before, and knew full well
that to find the Grail and be purified by it, would be the
highest honour a knight could attain. He hoped to glean some
clues from the King to help him in the quest. But King Pellam
told him nothing new, and so, when at last the jug was empty of
ale, he bid him goodbye and left]

;
[928:on some more stairs. Lancelot explored the rest of the
castle, but found little of interest. Many of the rooms seemed to
be disused, and others had their doors locked. After casting a
eye over some of the more interesting tapestries and relics, he
returned whence he came]
;
[929:readying himself to jump for his life before the boat was
dashed to pieces on the rocks, when a sudden gust of wind blew
the boat back from the shore]
;
[930:in the castle of Sir Ector. He greeted his brother warmly,
and they ate and talked of their travels and of the latest news
from Camelot. At last they bade each other fond farewells and
Lancelot left]
;
[931:in front of the castle. He rode the circuit of its walls,
but could find no way in, so he returned to the road]

[1103:. It was dark and rank with the ^N smells of sweat and
rotting straw, for little light or air came through from the
^N opening high above. A long, vicious ^N whip hung upon the ^N
wall, close at hand] ; in a lower prison
;
[1104:, a small stone-flagged ^N square. A solid, ugly building
with barred windows lay to the north side. Lower and more homely
wings ran off to east and west and joined up with the wall in
which lay the arched gateway] ;in the ^N courtyard
;
[1105:, a narrow, twisting place, dark save for a poor grey light
that seeped in from the open ends] ; secret room
;
[1106:, under a wide ^N arch of ^N stone dressed with crumbling
^N mortar] ; in the entrance
;
[1107:of stone with a timbered floor. The massive ^N gates of
wrought ^N iron had been flung back wide. leaving the ^N manor
open and defenceless] ; in a gateway
;
[1108:. The ^N ceiling was so low that ^N Lancelot could barely
stand up straight, and ^N puddles of foul ^N water had collected
on the uneven ^N floor. A pile of straw lay in one corner, by way
of a bed, but it was sodden and offered no comfort] ; in a cell
;
[1109:, beneath the castle. The damp sheen on the walls glinted
eerily in the flickering torchlight, and deep were the shadows of
the cell doors.] ; in a prison corridor
;
[1110:, a long narrow ^N room, with a rough ^N pile of ^N straw
at the end. A tiny ^N grille, set out of reach in the high ^N
ceiling, let in a little ^N light, but showed nothing of what lay
above. The walls were scored on to the walls, as earlier
prisoners had counted up the days of their incarceration] ; in a
; ^N cell
;
[1112:, an echoing stone ^N chamber from whence heavy wooden ^N
doors led into the ^N cells. It was so cold that ^N Lancelot
could see his own ^N breath] ; in a prison
;
[1113:, close by the bare mainmast. The dry timbers creaked
beneaath his feet, and the air was thick with the smell of pitch
from fresh caulking of the seams] ; on deck
;
[1114:. The ^N rooms were far taller than in most ^N castles ^N
Lancelot had known, so tall that the ^N ceilings were lost in the
gloom above. The charcoal grey ^N walls were built thick enough
to withstand any ^N onslaught, and the ^N windows were but slits,
that let little natural light into the gloomy chambers] ; in a
; castle
;
[1115:, where the ^N cells did seem to have been made from
ancient natural ^N caves, and not carved from the rock by man.
The earth ^N floor was sometimes rock hard and at others sludgy
with dampness, while cramped ^N passages led off to the ^N cells.
Every sound echoed eerily around the caverns, and there was ever
a dripping of water] ; in a prison
;
[1116:, treacherous to walk upon, so worn and crumbled by the
years. Wooden ^N slats had been set upon the stone ^N ledges at
some time, but many had rotted or fallen away] ; on some stairs
;
[1117:, a small ^N chamber with a roaring ^N fire at the far end.
^N Cauldrons of steaming ^N water hung within the ^N fireplace,
and a huge ^N pile of large ^N towels was set upon a ^N shelf to
one side of the ^N hearth, warming by the ^N fire. The whole
chamber was so filled with steam and the smoke from the fire that
it was nigh impossible to see from one end to the other] ; in a
; room with a bath
;
[1118:, a wide ^N room lit by ^N torches in ornate ^N holders fixed
to the ^N walls. ^N Trophies of the ^N hunt and of ^N battle hung
all around] ; in a hall
;
[1119:that spiralled tightly upwards within the ^N tower. Slit ^N
windows, on each landing, looked out towards the ^N shoreline]
; on some stairs
;
[1120:. It was very dark, but Lancelot could make out a ^N
washstand and a large ^N bed with a plump ^N mattress and a ^N
washstand in the ^N gloom. Tattered drapes of heavy grey cloth
added to the shadows, and billowed oftimes from the draughts
behind them] ; in the perilous bedroom
;
[1121:, broad and solid and dusted with green mosses. Pushing the
^N leaves aside, Lancelot could see the upper ^N branches
reaching high above] ; in the lower branches of the elm
;
[1122:. The soft golden ^N glow of flickering ^N firelight and
tallow ^N candles lit up the huge four poster ^N bed, with its
coverings of ^N samite and heavy ^N drapes all around. Delicately
woven ^N tapestries hung upon the ^N walls and the air was heavy
with a musky ^N scent. In truth, it was a place to enchant any
man] ; in Elaine's bedroom
;
[1123:, a small squat ^N building, with a simple wooden ^N cross
atop its mossy thatched ^N roof. Within it was bare, but for a
few ancient ^N relics upon the ^N walls and large ^N altar]
; in chapel with tomb
;
[1124:, an imposing ^N building in smooth pale ^N stone atop a ^N
hill that commanded the surrounding ^N country. Within, the ^N
rooms were light and airy, hung with gay ^N tapestries, and
furnished for comfort] ; in castle Lyonesse
;
[1125:. ^N Debris of ^N wood and ^N stone littered the ^N floor,
where weeds and bushes grew amongst the cracked ^N flags, and the
^N walls were green with ^N lichens, while thick ^N cobwebs hung
from the pillars] ; in a decaying hall
;
[1126:. It was a narrow ^N passage, with ^N plants overhanging
the ^N doorway, creating a green ^N light which shone into the ^N
shadows of the ^N chapel beyond] ; in the entrance to chapel
; perilous
;
[1127:, where dark wooden ^N pillars rose up to darker ^N
rafters, and thick ^N cobwebs draped the ^N statues that stood
around the ^N walls] ; inside the chapel
;
[1128:, a small cramped ^N room, with many strange ^N ornaments
and ^N relics lining the ^N walls and heaped upon the ^N floor.
The air was stale and foul with the smell of rottenness]
; in the inner chamber
;
[1129:. The ^N branches were much slimmer here and full of ^N sap,
with many a small ^N shoot bursting from the ^N tips. The ^N wind
blew more strongly at this height and the whole ^N treetop swayed
in the ^N breeze] ; atop the elm
;
[1130:, where the stone ^N steps gave way to ^N treads of ^N wood,
which creaked treacherously underfoot] ; on the stairs
;
[1131:. The ^N furniture looked old and well-used. It was cold,
and the ^N skins which hung across the ^N windows did little to
stop the ^N draughts that swirled through the ^N rooms] ; in the
; living quarters
;
[1132:, a broad sweeping ^N staircase hewn out of solid ^N stone]
; on the stairs
;
[1133:, heaped high with ^N straw. ^N Saddles and ^N tack were
hung upon the ^N stalls, and there was a rich ^N smell of horse]
; in a ^N stable
;
[1134:, which wound upwards steeply and unevenly in tight
circles] ; on the stairs
;
[1135:, a low, damp storeroom. The air was musty and laced with
the pungent ^N smell of liquor that wafted from some old oak ^N
casks set by the ^N wall. A ^N pile of dusty hempen ^N sacks lay
heaped against a large ^N chest. Some sacks had split, spilling
little ^N mounds of ^N barley on to the ^N floor] ; in the ^N
; basement
;
[1136:, cut through crumbling ^N shale, the roof held up in
places by ^N spars of ^N wood. Its ^N roof was at times so low
that the going had to be made on ^N hands and ^N knees] ; in a
; tunnel
;
[1137:, a tiny box of a place with scarce room enough for a man
to stand or even to lie at length. The air was warm and rank with
the smell of confinement] ; in a ^N prison
;
;; [1138:] ; NO LONG DESCRIPTION for Guardroom
;
[1139:. It was a small but airy room, with a tall ^N window
leading up to its high ceiling. An unfenced opening was set into
the centre of the ^N floor, with a heavy lever close by]
; in an upper prison
;
[1145:, a grassy ^N stretch, pitted with stagnant ^N mudpools and
bordered by tall ^N bullrushes that grew in the ^N shallows. The
river was wide here and flowed lazily] ; on a riverbank
;
[1146:, its woodwork soft and rotten. Many of its ^N planks were
splintered, or gaping, so that the ^N water below was clearly
seen] ; on a decrepit bridge
;
[1147:. It was taller than the nearby ^N buildings, built of grey
^N stone, with many high narrow ^N windows. It seemed to have
falen into disuse, for the tall ^N chimney was still that rose
from the fraying ^N thatch, and the ^N grounds that had once been
neatly ordered, where rank and overgrown with ^N nettles] ;
outside a ^N ; manor ^N house
;
[1148:. The dense ^N growth of tall ^N conifers, soaring straight
up like ^N spires, cut out the ^N sunlight from the ^N forest ^N
floor. The ^N ground was softly carpeted with ^N pine ^N needles
and strewn with ^N cones. Squirrels darted from branch to branch,
and there were larger animals browsing in the shadows] ; in
forest Meliot
;
[1149:that twisted and wound around ^N boulders and ^N bushes,
and was oftimes in deep shadow from overhanging ^N trees. It was
a ^N place of ambushes and treachery] ; on a dangerous road

lined on either side with ^N hedges of ^N box] ; track outside
Turquin's manor

through the broad ^N branches of the ^N trees. The ^N ground was
deep with soft ^N leaf ^N mould] ; on a forest track
;
[1152:. The long straight ^N highway stretched east-west as far
as the ^N eye could see and had been laid with flat ^N stones,
though ^N weeds now sprouted plentifully in the ^N cracks. The ^N
turret threw a long dark ^N shadow across the ^N way] ; Roman
; road beside a turret

[1153:. The ^N track split into two here, both ^N paths of
trampled rotting ^N leaves, although the higher of them looked
somewhat drier underfoot] ; at a junction in the forest
;
[1154:, a squat ^N tower built of small ^N stones mortared
together. A heavy ^N shutter hung beside the narrow arched ^N
window] ; in Garlon's turret
;
[1155:. The cool dusk of the ^N forest gave way to a sunny
^N meadow sprinkled with ^N buttercups and ^N cowslips, and
humming with ^N bees and other ^N insects. A small ^N castle
stood beyond the meadow, bathed in the warm glow of the evening
sun] ; at a big clearing beside the castle of forest Sauvage

treacherous by tangled ^N thorns that stretched out to catch the

and worn, but the worst of the holes had been filled with ^N
rubble and broken ^N stones] ; on a roman road through forest
; Sauvage
;
[1158:, wide and even as it traversed the ^N moors or followed
alongside ^N rivers but a narrow stony ^N track where it wound
around ^N hills, or descended into wooded ^N vales. In ^N places,
the ^N track had been stamped into a hard smooth ^N surface by ^N
carts and the ^N feet of ^N men and ^N horses, and the here ^N
roadside was dotted with ^N cairns. But where few ^N travellers
used the ^N road, the going was rough and slow. Smaller tracks
led off to the villages and settlements along the way, and
makeshift milestones counted the miles, though many of the
letters cut into the stones were too worn or overgrown to read]

and kept free of ^N weeds and encroaching ^N undergrowth] ; on a

from the ^N winter ^N storms lay piled up on the ^N sides] ; on
; the coast road

[1161:, the ^N headland jutting out fiercely into the foaming ^N
ocean below. At the very ^N top of the sheer ^N cliff rose the
dark grey ^N castle, its ^N battlements commanding the sea
approaches from ^N Wales and the ^N lands of north Cornwall
behind. The country to the south was green and gently rolling, at
odds with the harsh coastline] ; at Tintagel
;
[1162: The ^N dry ^N stone ^N wall was speckled with ^N lichens
and small ^N plants wedged into its ^N crevices. Mounted,
Lancelot could see over the ^N top to the rolling ^N lands to the
north east, where a great army lay encamped around the castle of
Tintagel] ; on a walled road

[1164:, where scattered ^N outcrops of dark grey ^N rock pushed
up from the golden ^N sand, leaving deep ^N pools at their ^N
feet. The land behind rose up through grassy ^N dunes to rolling
^N fields beyond, and curved round in a wide ^N bay ending in
tall ^N headlands] ; on a beach
;
[1166:, covered in short coarse ^N grass, the ^N peak a bare
^N head of hard ^N granite. The ^N slopes were dotted with
smaller ^N granite ^N outcrops, and a maze of ^N rabbit ^N tracks
wove all between] ; on a hill

over the ^N tops of bleak ^N moors, oftimes following the ^N
course of their ^N ridges. And always it was narrow and winding]
; on a winding road
;
[1168:, that was clearly much used, for the ^N ground was worn
and pitted with ^N footmarks and gouged by ^N horses ^N hooves. A
small ^N patch of straggling ^N grass marked the ^N centre of the
^N crossing, and here a smooth round boulder had once served as
signpost, but the directions carved upon it had been worn away by
wind and rain or hidden beneath lichens] ; at a crossroads
;
[1169:, standing sole, far out into the sea, as it were some
massive ^N boulder flung thence by giant. It was encompassed by
^N cliffs that had crumbled here and there into hard rocky ^N
beaches. Over the central ^N dome of the ^N island grew a thatch
of coarse ^N grass, and the air was alive with seabirds,
shrieking and wailing over their vast colonies on the cliff
ledges] ; on an ^N island
;
[1170:. The shore was of sea-rounded ^N rocks and ^N pebbles, and
from here a narrow track led up, past a tall square ^N tower
built upon a rocky ^N hill, and on towards a ^N village. There
could be seen squat, solid ^N cottages and a small stone ^N
church]
;
[1171:, a ^N cluster of tiny stone ^N houses, huddled together in
the lee of a ^N hill, sheltering from the constant ^N winds.
Their ^N doors faced inland, and ^N smoke blew furiously from the
^N chimneys. A few sparse ^N strips of farmed ^N land could be
seen behind the ^N cottages] ; in Corbin village

walls, and ^N crows circled slowly above its tall sharp ^N
towers.It had the air of a place accursed, and pitiful were the
^N cries and ^N moans that escaped its thick ^N walls. Lancelot
would fain have tried to help those poor ^N souls within, but the
^N castle had no entrance save through an immense ^N door, and
that made out of solid oak with heavy ^N straps of ^N iron. It
was shut fast and stayed so for all his efforts] ; at the ^N

[1198:. The ^N ground squelched underfoot, and ^N bitterns boomed
their hollow cries from amid the coarse ^N reed ^N beds. A ^N
castle stood upon an ^N outcrop of solid ^N rock that rose from
the flat lands beyond. It was strong and well-built, yet, rising
out of the marshy mists, it had a semblance of insubstantiality
about it, as though its solid walls hovered above the ground]
; on a reedy isle beside a castle
;
[1199:. Oily stagnant ^N pools gave way to brown shifting ^N mud,
with sparse ^N tufts of ^N grasses struggling for a ^N foothold
in the slippery oozing ^N lands. The ^N ground was flat and
without feature for as far as the ^N eye could see, and a grey ^N
mist hung over all] ; in a trackless marsh
;
[1200:. Raised above the level of the brackish ^N mud ^N flats,
and marked out with ^N pebbles, the ^N track was yet boggy and
difficult to follow] ; on a marsh road
;
[1201:. There were high ^N mounds, and ^N trenches deep and wide
enough to allow the passage of mounted ^N knights as well as ^N
foot ^N soldiers. The remains of past ^N battles were scattered
about the field, broken ^N swords and ^N spears, and ^N scraps of
^N chain ^N mail and ^N armour. It seemed to Lancelot that he
could hear the echoes of past battles, and ghosts of long-dead
knights seemed to linger on the air] ; at a siegeworks

^N trees] ; at a main road

Mosses and small ^N ferns grew in the ^N gaps in the ^N stones,

across the ^N face, and fallen ^N trees lay across the ^N track,
all but blocking the ^N way] ; on an overgrown road
;
[1211:. The ^N slopes were bare and craggy, with a sparse ^N
covering of tough ^N grasses and low ^N gorse ^N bushes. A biting
cold ^N wind blew from the north and echoed round the ^N tower,
ancient and battered by harsh winter ^N gales] ; on a hill,
; beside a tower

^N headlands. Long stretches of weed covered ^N rocks, with deep
^N pools to seaward, made the going treacherous] ; on a beach
;
[1213:, in the midst of low swirling ^N clouds. Nought grew up
there, save for thin ^N patches of grey-green ^N lichens on the

in the ^N mists, there was a deep sense of solitude] ; on a ^N
; mountaintop

^N path folowed a twisting route along ^N ridges and across the

clouds that hung about the ^N summit. At times it crossed long ^N
scree runs, where the horse had to scramble for its footing] ; on
; a mountainside

bushes in a ^N patchwork of purple and yellow] ; on a glen
;
[1216:, dozens of ^N islands, scattered at random in the ^N sea.
The larger ^N isles were bare save for short thick ^N grass and
stunted wind-bowed ^N trees. Hardy ^N sheep, protected from the
^N gales by their thick ^N fleeces, grazed on the sparse ^N
ground, oblivious to the ^N elements. The few settlements were of
low stout crofts, huddled together for shelter from the constant
gales. Many had not endured the wilder storms and lay open-topped
and ruined, used only as makeshift sheep pens] ; in the Orkneys
;
[1217:, a land of fertile broadleaved ^N woods and lush ^N
pasture in the south, yielding to the majesty of imposing ^N
peaks and deep narrow ^N lochs in the north, the ^N valleys
covered in dark secretive ^N pine ^N forests, the gentle lower ^N
slopes of the ^N hills carpeted with springy ^N heather and the
bright yellow of ^N gorse. There was a scatter of rough stone ^N
crofts and small ^N villages, homes to a fierce and hardy race,
ever ready to do battle for their wild but beautiful land] ; in
; Scotland
;
[1218:, a bleak ^N no-man's ^N land between ^N Scotland and the
^N realm of ^N Logris. The ^N marches were crossed by a great ^N
wall, built many long years since to keep out the wild tribes of
the north. Now it lay unused, its ^N battlements reduced in part
to ^N rubble, yet elsewhere it stood strong, the ^N towers firm
against the ^N skyline] ; in the marches
;
[1219:. In its centre stood on old ^N apple ^N tree, its ^N

its ^N blossom sweeting the air. Above the encompassing ^N wood

from the only saint that ever was in these parts, and now keep it
in my pillow. So be you afeared, sir knight, for tomorrow we

atop the altar and chewing on a bone. He draw his sword and set
upon the beast, but its fiery breath and daggered claws were
almost a match for his strength and skill. The battle raged from
noon to dusk, till at last, Lancelot, though sorely wounded with
deep scores and burns, slew the great beast with one desperate
lunge.] ; Corbin Chapel

[1474:. Dame Lyonesse greeted Lancelot and thanked him warmly for
restoring her estates unto her. She wished to reward him for his

the Red Knight, adding that Lynet, the Damosel Maledisant, could
stay with him. She then retired to tend to her wounded soldiers,

caught his breath and spoke on, "I bring news from King Mark of

[2611:Lancelot entered the castle, and was told that King Pelles
and his daughter Elaine had commanded a feast in his honour. The
banquet was magnificent, and afterwards, King Pelles bade his
goodnights and withdrew, leaving Elaine and her saviour alone.
Before Lancelot had time to think of pleasantries, he realized
that Elaine was blushingly flirting with him. In truth, she made
her love for him plain, and at length invited him to stay the
night. Taking him by the hand, she led him to the bedchambers,
and then paused in the corridor outside. She breathed, "Come to
me tonight, my love", and then slipped quietly into her room]
;
[2612:Lancelot entered the room and saw Elaine within the bed.
She turned to him and stretched forth an arm in welcome, the soft
sheets slipping to reveal her naked shoulders and ample breasts.
Did he quit the room forthwith? ]
;
[2613:Lancelot locked the door behind him. The ecstasy of that
night would stay with him forever. But so would his betrayal of
his beloved Guenever. Yet somehow Lancelot knew that his actions
of the night had been fated to pass, and that they would prove in
time to be for good]
;
[2614:Lancelot stepped back and closed the door behind him,
resolute in his resolve to remain to be faithful to Guenever]

[2615:Lancelot could not leave his room before morning without losing
honour]
[2616:the panel was held shut by some magical force]
[2617:the blows merely rebounded, making not the least mark upon

[2618:Lancelot fell asleep straightway. But during the night he
was awakened by the creaking of the panel opening]
[2619:a glowing spear flew from within the opening. It smote
Lancelot in the shoulder, wounding him sorely, then it vanished.
The panel ground shut again]
[2620:a magical knight emerged]
[2621:an old man emerged, enveloped in adders which seethed
constantly around him. In his hand he bore a spear of vengeance]
[2622:four gentlewomen and a bishop emerged, then withdrew back  through

[2623:at last, a cock crowed in the castle grounds, and the bedroom door

again a moment later, healed full well and stronger than before]
[2625:the panel moved a little, but would not close completely]
[2626:the panel was now almost half shut]
[2627:the panel shut completely]
[2628:the old man blessed Lancelot for not attacking him, and

;
[2629:as Lancelot readied himself to leave the castle, Elaine
thrust a drink into his hands, a sparkling ruby-red liquid in a
clear crystal glass. He drank deeply, and felt a peaceful warmth
seep deep into his body at the very first draught. When he looked
up at Elaine, her face seemed to have grown large and luminous in
his gaze, and he could think of no other but her. In truth, it
was a love potion, as Lancelot himself dimly realized while yet
under its spell. Enthralled by its powers, he lay with Elaine,
but did so without guilt, for he had not the strength, of body or
mind, to resist. He came to see that it was his fate to sire a
son by Elaine, no matter how he might have tried to avoid it.
Afterwards, he left Corbin Castle, never to return]
