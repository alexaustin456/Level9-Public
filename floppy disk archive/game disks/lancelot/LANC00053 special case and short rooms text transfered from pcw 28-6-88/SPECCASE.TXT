     [2490:said "Welcome to Camelot, Lancelot. It has been foretold
     that you are destined to be one of the greatest of all knights. It's a
     pleasure to have you at court"]
     [2491:said "I was very impressed with your performance at the ford
     yesterday. You fought most nobly and bravely"]
     [2492:said musingly, "Of course, I'm particularly pleased that you
     spared me. Otherwise there would have been all sorts of trouble. Very
     honourable of you"]
     ;;[2492:turned suddenly grave, and seemed older than before. He told Lancelot to kneel
     before him, and when the squire had bent low upon his knees, the king
     drew out his sword and
     ;;tapped Lancelot briefly on each shoulder. "Arise, Sir Lancelot", said Arthur
     solemnly, and newly knighted young man did so, his armour squeaking
     audibly at the joints. Arthur put his sword away and grinned at him.
     "One of us now, eh?" he said cheerfully ]
     ;;[2493:told Lancelot to leave. Guenever fluttered her eyelashes at
     ;;Lancelot in an inviting fashion, and held his gaze for rather longer
     than was necessary]


     [2493:knighted Lancelot, and insisted that
     he stay and dine with them. As they sat
     through the meal, and the drinks flowed, Lancelot kept stealing
     glances across at Queen Guenever. Truly, he thought, she was a
     beautiful and stately woman. And as the meal wore on, he realized he
     was falling in love with her.% Once or twice he caught Guenever
     casting him sidelong looks in return, almost coyly, and eventually,
     feeling like a small boy, he plucked up the courage to ask to be her
     champion. As he had feared, she refused to consider being championed
     by a novice, and for a dreadful moment Lancelot thought she would
     rebuff him entirely.%
     But then Guenever smiled knowingly at him and invited him to return to
     her when he had proved himself to be worthy of her patronage. At this,
     Lancelot felt a huge swell of pride and promised he would not fail
     her, but would go to Logris without delay, there to honour Guenever
     with noble deeds and battles chivalrously won.%
     Then Arthur looked up from his plate and looked at Lancelot. "I tell
     you one thing you could do. There are some knights of mine - all
     honourable fellows of the Round Table here - who are being held
     captive by these rebel lords who seem to think they own the place.

     was a far worthier knight than he had assumed at first and soon he was
     fighting desperately, with more strength than he had known he
     possessed. Finally, completely exhausted, the
     black knight yielded. Did Lancelot accept his surrender? ]

     him to the ground and unfastening his helmet with feverish fingers, ready for the
     fatal blow.%

     the bushes and threw him to the ground. Even as Lancelot tried to get
     up, his sword was swiftly taken from him, and several burly men pinned
     him down.%
      %The black knight identified himself as King Arthur, and severely
     chastised Lancelot for his lack of honour or chivalry. The king's

     to the Round Table, if thou wouldst care to come
     tomorrow, to my castle in Camelot."%

     long, but I hope to see you again soon". ]
     [3004: Bors de Ganis said, "Fair greetings, sir, you are a most
     welcome sight to me in my plight". ]
     [3005:Sir Question Mark looked briefly at Lancelot, "Good day, sir -
     have we met before?". ]
     [3006:Gawain cried out, "Lancelot, you have not come a moment too
     soon!". ]
     [3007:the Red Knight said, "Wait, knight. If you want to journey
     further you must do battle with me for the right to ride past". ]
     [3008:Meliot said feebly, "Help me, Lancelot, for I cannot last much
     longer". ]
     [3009:Lamorak said, "Lancelot my saviour, truly I feared you might not
     get here in time". ]
     [3010:Ector de Maris said, "My brother, you have reached me just in
     time". ]

     [3112:Aliduke advanced towards Lancelot and said, "Greetings, fair
     sir, it is an honour to have you with us". ]

     arrival from my comrades". ]
     [3114:Brian said, "It is always a pleasure to meet a new knight of the
     round table". ]
     [3115:Geheris said: "Hello, sir, already I have heard tell of
     some of your deeds". ]
     [3116:Gareth nodded to Lancelot, "I look forward to testing your
     strength on the jousting field before long". ]
     [3117:Lionel said warmly, "Greetings, uncle, 'tis good to see you
     again". ]
     [3118:Marhaus said: "Welcome sir, 'tis a pleasure to have you join the

     [3058:Sir Kay said, "Well I never, look what the mouse dragged in.
     If you have any business in this place, I suggest you go and sleep
     in the mews. They're cheap, which should suit you fine, and not far
     from here". He gestured arrogantly to the north, "Be off with you,
     peasant. There's a curfew for the lower classes, you know". ]
     [3062:Merlin said, "Greetings, Lancelot. Your coming was foretold
     to me in a dream". ]
