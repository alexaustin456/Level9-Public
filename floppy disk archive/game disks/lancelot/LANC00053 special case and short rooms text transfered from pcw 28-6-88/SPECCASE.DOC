Arthur put his sword away and grinned at him. Š"One of us now, eh?" he said cheerfully ] Š;;[2493:told Lancelot to leave.

[2493:knighted Lancelot, and insisted that Šhe stay and dine with them. As they sat Šthrough the meal, and the drinks flowed, Lancelot kept stealing Šglances across at Queen Guenever. Truly, he thought, she was a Šbeautiful and stately woman. And as the meal wore on, he realized he Šwas falling in love with her.% Once or twice he caught Guenever Šcasting him sidelong looks in return, almost coyly, and eventually, Šfeeling like a small boy, he plucked up the courage to ask to be her Šchampion. As he had feared, she refused to consider being championed Šby a novice, and for a dreadful moment Lancelot thought she would Šrebuff him entirely.% ŠBut then Guenever smiled knowingly at him and invited him to return to Šher when he had proved himself to be worthy of her patronage. At this, ŠLancelot felt a huge swell of pride and promised he would not fail Šher, but would go to Logris without delay, there to honour Guenever Šwith noble deeds and battles chivalrously won.% ŠThen Arthur looked up from his plate and looked at Lancelot. "I tell Šyou one thing you could do. There are some knights of mine - all Šhonourable fellows of the Round Table here - who are being held Šcaptive by these rebel lords who seem to think they own the place. ŠNow, if you could bring some of them back to Camelot as free men, that Šwould make you pretty worthy of anyone, for a start" ]
