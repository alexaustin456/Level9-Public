     ; 940..1030 are real rooms for part 1
     [940:in the ^N guest ^N room. It was sparsely furnished, but it looked
     clean]
     [941:in the ^N study. A thin light straggled in through a high narrow
     window]
     [942:in ^N Merlin's ^N library. The room was a jumble of papers,
     opened, crumbling books and phials containing strangely coloured liquids ]
     [943:on ^N Merlin's ^N stairs. They creaked with age, and some of the
     steps were alarmingly cracked]
     [944:in the ^N mews. A couple of slit windows let a little light in,
     but not much in the way of fresh air]
     [945:in the ^N stables. An overwhelming smell of horse assaulted
     Lancelot's nostrils]
     [946:in the ^N kennels. Excited yelps from the inhabitants greeted the
     intruder]
     [947:in the ^N hall containing the ^N Round ^N Table. It was a high-
     ceilinged room with a stone flagged floor. The Round Table dominated
     the scene]
     [948:in Lancelot's ^N bedchamber, a clean but austerely furnished room]
     [949:in Guenever's ^N bedchamber, a soft, warm feminine room]
     [950:on the ^N stairs. His footsteps on the bare stone echoed around the walls]
     [951:in Arthur's ^N hall in the ^N castle, a vast echoing room, lit
     and kept warm mainly by the fire which roared in the hearth at the far
     end, and spat out showers of embers on to the stone floor in front of
     it]
     [952:inside the ^N Serf's ^N gate. Untidy piles of rubbish lay
     scattered on the ground, while young servants and messenger boys
     scurried to and fro]
     [953:in the ^N cathedral, which had a atmosphere of spiritual calm,
     nmarked contrast to the bustle and noise outside ]
     [954:before the ^N altar, with its candleabra of polished silver and
     silken cloths covering the altar table]
     [955:inside the ^N Bishop's ^N gate]
     [956:in ^N Guenever's ^N boudoir. Soft furnishings and drapes covered
     every available surface, and a sweet smell of perfume hung in the air ]
     [957:in the ^N royal ^N suite. These rooms were much larger than the
     others, and the wall hangings and bed coverings were decorated with
     heraldic crests]
     [958:in the ^N guest ^N suite, which had been freshly cleaned and swept]
     [959:on the ^N stairs. Some of the steps were uneven and chipped]
     [960:in the ^N prison, a small dark cell. The stone walls were soft
     and damp to the touch and the air smelt of mould and decay]
     [961:in ^N Meliagaunt's ^N hall, a narrow high ceilinged room. A fire
     at one end sputtered and struggled to stay alight]

     ; outside rooms for part 1...
     [964:on a ^N forest ^N road. Dense forest hung over the rough track,
     which was pitted with the marks of horses' hooves]
     [965:wading through the ^N ford. Although the river was wide and
     shallow, it ran quite fast here]
     [966:on a ^N road. Through occasional breaks in the trees, he could
     see farmland]
     [967:on a ^N road through the peasant village. Untidy mud and straw huts
     dotted the roadside at irregular intervals]
     [968:outside the ^N serf's ^N gate. A shallow muddy track led through
     the gates, and a hubbub of voices could be heard from the far side]
     [969:on the ^N road. The track was full of potholes]
     [970:on the ^N road. Parts of it were very muddy, and he had to ride
     in twists and turns to avoid the puddles]
     [971:on the ^N road. Trees and bushes grew thickly at the sides,






     overhanging the way forward]
     [972:on the ^N lawns beside the ^N cathedral. The grass was neatly
     tended and kept short, with flower beds showing off a riotous splash
     of colour]
     [973:outside the ^N cloisters. The ground here was obviously tended by
     the monks, with tidy bushes and flowering plants arranged neatly
     against the building]
     [974:on a ^N bridge over the ^N river ^N camel. The river gurgled
     beneath the rough-hewn bridge]
     [975:outside the ^N bishop's gate, an imposing structure wrought in
     iron]
     [976:in ^N Westminster ^N meadows. The lush wet grass was interspersed
     with clumps of wild flowers, and was alive with bees and other insects]
     [977:on a ^N straight ^N way. The untidy grassland stretched out on
     either side as far as Lancelot could see]
     [978:in a ^N garden, crowded with root vegetable crops and small fruit
     trees. A bed of herbs gave off a delicious aroma]
     [979:beside ^N castle ^N Meliagaunt. The fortress lare. There was a faint murmur and clatter
     around the square as
     the villagers lumbered to and fro, carrying straw and foodstuffs back
     to their homes]
     [1024:in the ^N north ^N warren. Shrubby undergrowth hid the thick
     gluey mud underfoot]
     [1025:on the ^N north ^N way, a winding road through a tangle of
     bushes and small trees]
     [1026:on the ^N road outside the mews. The ground was pock-marked with
     the imprints of horses' hooves and squelchy with mud] ; mews are. There was a faint murmur and clatter
     around the square as
     the villagers lumbered to and fro, carrying straw and foodstuffs back
     to their homes]
     [1024:in the ^N north ^N warren. Shrubby undergrowth hid the thick
     gluey mud underfoot]
     [1025:on the ^N north ^N way, a winding road through a tangle of
     bushes and small trees]
     [1026:on the ^N road outside the mews. The ground was pock-marked with
     the imprints of horses' hooves and squelchy with mud] ; mews object also here
     [1027:on the ^N King's ^N road, a wide well-worn fairway]

     ;; [1033:on a lake. The water was glassily still and so dark that he
     could not begin to guess at its depth]
     ;; [1034:on a rock, warm with the heat of the sun on the hillside. Valleys covered
     with thick dark woodland were spread out below him]
     ;; [1035:on a lake. A small breeze began to ripple the surface into
     white lipped ridges]
