The grail is at the Cerne Abbas Giant [ST 666017. A Guide to 
Ancient Sites in Britain, Janet and Colin Bord p35-36 number 20]. 

The map reference is made up in a very structured way as follows: 
                        A+B-Q : 6 = 6+7-7
                        C+D-O : 6 = 3+5-2
                        E+F-R : 6 = 5+6-5 
                        G-H+L : 0 = 6-9+3 
                        I+J-P : 1 = 2+5-6 
                        K+M-S : 7 = 7+4-4
