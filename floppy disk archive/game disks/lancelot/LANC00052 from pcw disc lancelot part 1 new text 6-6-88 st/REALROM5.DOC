     ;; who told him about the Holy Grail. Then he made his excuses and left]

     ; 933..940 are echo locations (basically for part 2)
     [933:in the castle rooms. Trophies of battles won and lost honourably
     decorated the walls - the head of a hart here, a battered suit of
     armour there. Heavy drapes covered some of the walls to keep out the
     worst of the draughts, and some hung over dark corridor openings or
     flights of stairs. Lancelot found nothing of interest, so he left
     again]
     [934:in the cloisters, where the monks could be seen earnestly at
     prayer. A few kneeling near the back turned their heads to peer slily at
     their uninvited visitor. Lancelot was reluctant to disturb them, so he
     retreated silently]

     [935:in the upstairs rooms of the castle. In the twisting corridors,
     he frequently got lost, or inadvertently doubled back on himself. On
     the whole, the rooms were surprisingly spartan for the court of a
     king, although they were all very spick and span, but the high
     ceilings and narrow slit windows made them extremely draughty.
     Lancelot found nothing of interest, so he returned to the stairs]

     [936:in the downstairs rooms of the castle. The public rooms were vast and
     well-lit by the many flaming torches hanging from the walls, but the
     back rooms were altogether pokier, darker, and smellier. Shouts as






     orders were given and taken, and snatches of jovial conversation
     filtered through some of the heavy oak doors. Occasionally
     he would pass servants or messengers, hurrying through the dim halls.
     Lancelot found nothing of interest, so he returned to the hall]

     [941:in the ^N study. A thin ^N light straggled in through a high narrow
     ^N window]
     [942:in ^N Merlin's ^N library. The ^N room was a jumble of ^N papers,
     opened, crumbling ^N books and ^N phials containing strangely coloured
     ^N liquids ]
     [943:on ^N Merlin's ^N stairs. They creaked with age, and some of the
     ^N steps were alarmingly cracked]
     [944:in the ^N mews. A couple of slit ^N windows let a little ^N light in,
     but not much in the way of fresh ^N air]
     [945:in the ^N stables. An overwhelming smell of ^N horse assaulted
     Lancelot's ^N nostrils]
     [946:in the ^N kennels. Excited ^N yelps from the inhabitants greeted the
     ^N intruder]
     [947:in the ^N hall containing the ^N Round ^N Table. It was a high-
     ceilinged ^N room with a stone flagged ^N floor. The ^N Round ^N Table dominated
     the ^N scene]
     [948:in Lancelot's ^N bedchamber, a clean but austerely furnished ^N room]
     [949:in Guenever's ^N bedchamber, a soft, warm feminine ^N room]
     [950:on the ^N stairs. His ^N footsteps on the bare ^N stone echoed around the
     ^N walls]
     [951:in Arthur's ^N hall in the ^N castle, a vast echoing ^N room, lit
     and kept warm mainly by the ^N fire which roared in the ^N hearth at the far
     end]
     [952:inside the ^N Serf's ^N gate. Untidy ^N piles of ^N rubbish lay
     scattered on the ^N ground, while young ^N servants and ^N messenger
     ^N boys
     scurried to and fro]
     [953:in the ^N cathedral, which had a atmosphere of spiritual calm,
     in marked contrast to the bustle and ^N noise outside ]
     [954:before the ^N altar, with its ^N candleabrum of polished silver and
     silken ^N cloths covering the ^N altar ^N table]
     [955:inside the ^N Bishop's ^N gate, on a wide ^N path weaving between
     grassy, well-kept ^N lawns]
     [956:in ^N Guenever's ^N boudoir. Soft ^N furnishings and ^N drapes covered
     every available ^N surface, and a sweet smell of ^N perfume hung in the
     ^N air ]
     [957:in the ^N royal ^N suite. These ^N rooms were much larger than the
     others, and the ^N wall ^N hangings and ^N bed ^N coverings were decorated with
     ^N heraldic ^N crests]
     [958:in the ^N guest ^N suite, which had been freshly cleaned and swept]
     [959:on the ^N stairs. Some of the ^N steps were uneven and chipped]
     [960:in the ^N prison, a small dark ^N cell. The ^N stone ^N walls were soft
     and damp to the touch and the ^N air smelt of mould and decay]
     [961:in ^N Meliagaunt's ^N hall, a narrow high ceilinged ^N room. A ^N fire
     at one end sputtered and struggled to stay alight]

     ; outside rooms for part 1...
     [964:on a ^N forest ^N road. Dense ^N forest hung over the rough ^N track,
     which was pitted with the ^N marks of ^N horses' ^N hooves]
     [965:wading through the ^N ford. Although the ^N river was wide and






     shallow, it ran quite fast here]
     [966:on a ^N road. Through occasional ^N breaks in the ^N trees, he could
     see ^N farmland]
     [967:on a ^N road through the peasant ^N village. Untidy mud and straw
     ^N huts
     dotted the ^N roadside at irregular intervals]
     [968:outside the ^N serf's ^N gate. A shallow muddy ^N track led through
     the ^N gates, and a hubbub of ^N voices could be heard from the far side]
     [969:on the ^N road. The ^N track was full of ^N potholes]
     [970:on the ^N road. Parts of it were very muddy, and he had to ride
     in twists and turns to avoid the ^N puddles]
     [971:on the ^N road. ^N Trees and ^N bushes grew thickly at the ^N sides,
     overhanging the ^N way forward]
     [972:on the ^N lawns beside the ^N cathedral. The ^N grass was neatly
     tended and kept short, with ^N flower ^N beds showing off a riotous splash
     of colour]
     [973:outside the ^N cloisters. The ^N ground here was obviously tended by
     the ^N monks, with tidy ^N bushes and flowering ^N plants arranged neatly
     against the ^N building]
     [974:on a ^N bridge over the ^N river ^N camel. The ^N river gurgled
     beneath the rough-hewn ^N bridge]
     [975:outside the ^N bishop's gate, an imposing ^N structure wrought in
     ^N iron]
     [976:in ^N Westminster ^N meadows. The lush wet ^N grass was interspersed
     with ^N clumps of wild ^N flowers, and was alive with ^N bees and other
     ^N insects]
     [977:on a ^N straight ^N way. The untidy ^N grassland stretched out on
     either ^N side as far as Lancelot could see]
     [978:in a ^N garden, crowded with root ^N vegetable ^N crops and small
     ^N fruit
     ^N trees. A bed of ^N herbs gave off a delicious ^N aroma]

     ; 940..1030 are real rooms for part 1

     [1100:in the ^N guest ^N room . There was a simple wood-framed ^N bed in
     the ^N centre of the ^N room, with a bedside ^N table next to it. A ^N tapestry
     protraying a stirring battle ^N scene hung on the ^N wall ]
     [1101:in the ^N study , with which Lancelot could discern an old
     ^N armchair, sprouting with ^N horsehair and a number of ^N books piled
     untidily on the ^N floor around it ]
     [1102:in ^N Merlin's ^N library . Some of them had spilled over the
     ^N furniture, and burned away the ^N fabric, while others gave off strange
     ^N smoke. ^N Skins and ^N heads of ^N animals were hanging on the ^N walls, doubtless
     to be used for ^N Merlin's ^N experiments, and curiously fashioned ^N pieces of
     smooth ^N wood were suspended from ^N hooks set into the ^N ceiling. In one
     ^N corner of the ^N room a number of ^N frogs hopped lazily in and out of a
     large ^N tank of ^N water.% A thick ^N film of ^N dust lay over
     most of the ^N objects, which made it impossible to determine exactly
     what they were]

     [1103:on ^N Merlin's ^N stairs . It was also very gloomy and dark, so
     ^N Lancelot had to be careful not to miss his ^N footing]
     [1104:in the ^N mews . It smelt dry and chalky, but the thick ^N thatch
     of the ^N roof kept it fairly warm]

     [1105:in the ^N stables . ^N Noises of
     whinnying and stamping could be heard from the depths of the ^N barn]

     [1106:in the ^N kennels , and the ^N air smelt strongly of damp ^N dog.
     ^N Lancelot had difficulty standing upright in the low-ceilinged ^N room]
     [1107:in the ^N hall containing the ^N Round
     ^N Table , its ^N shape that of a ^N wheel without ^ spokes, so that the
     ^N knights could be served their ^N meals from ^N servants on the inside. It
     was made of highly polished ^N wood, finished to a glassy smooth ^N surface,
     and at every ^N seat, a small ^N plaque named the ^N knight whose ^N place it was
     in simple gold ^N lettering]
     [1108:in Lancelot's ^N bedchamber with a sturdy wooden ^N bed, covered
     with spotless but rough ^N blankets, a ^N water ^N jug on the ^N bench next to it
     and a ^N stand where he could hang his ^N armour. A ^N fire had been lit and the
     ^N room
     was cosily warm]
     [1109:in Guenever's ^N
     bedchamber , kept exceptionally warm by the ^N fire which was frequently
     stoked. ^N Bottles of beauty ^N preparations lined the ^N shelves, and
     ^N etchings
     showing ^N scenes from romantic ^N legends hung on the ^N walls]
     [1110:on the ^N stairs . From a ^N window set into the ^N half-landing, he
     had a
     fine ^N view of the ^N lands surrounding ^N Camelot ]
     [1111:in Arthur's ^N hall in the
     ^N castle , which spat out showers of ^N embers on to the stone ^N floor in front of
     it. The ^N fire and the ^N wall ^N torches gave a flickering gold ^N light
     which made the ^N room seem more welcoming than its ^N size would suggest]
     [1112:inside the ^N Serf's ^N gate . A few stray ^N dogs and ^N cats
     pecked at the ^N debris on the dusty ^N ground]






     [1113:in the ^N
     cathedral . ^N Statues of ^N saints lined the walls, and ^N Lancelot
     found that his every ^N footstep echoed around the ^N pillars and up into
     the ^N rafters]
     [1114:before the ^N altar . A great ^N tapestry hung heavily on the ^N wall
     behind it and the ^N altar ^N table seemed flooded with ^N light from the
     side
     ^N windows]
     [1115:inside the ^N Bishop's ^N
     gate . A small tidy ^N hedge marked out the ^N limits of the ^N path]
     [1116:in ^N Guenever's ^N boudoir . A couple of rich silken ^N dresses
     were folded neatly over a ^N chest, and still more ^N finery could be seen
     spilling out of a wide ^N cupboard]
     [1117:in the ^N royal ^N
     suite . The ^N bed in particular was enormous, with a richly decorated
     ^N cover of purple ^N samite]
     [1118:in the ^N guest ^N suite . A large ^N display of wild ^N flowers in a
     ^N pot on the ^N window ^N seat gave the ^N room a fresh welcoming ^N smell]
     [1119:on the ^N stairs , but where the ^N stone was smooth, the ^N steps had
     been ground to a fine ^N polish and almost shone]
     [1120:in the ^N prison . The only ^N light came from a tiny ^N window,
     heavily barred, set high up against the ^N ceiling, while a thin smattering
     of dirty ^N straw covered the ^N floor ]
     [1121:in ^N Meliagaunt's ^N hall  in the ^N draught which blew in from
     the open ^N windows. Some of the ^N wall ^N torches had already gone out, which
     made it difficult to see into the ^N shadows of the ^N room]

     ; outside rooms for part 1...
     [1124:on a ^N forest ^N road . Sometimes the ^N sun was blotted out by
     the ^N thickness of the ^N branches of the taller ^N trees]
     [1125:wading through the ^N ford , gurgling merrily over the rough
     ^N track into a deeper ^N pool beyond]
     [1126:on
     a ^N road , comprising of a mixture of ^N crops and ^N sheep grazing. He
     could spot a few bent-over ^N figures of ^N farmworkers in the ^N fields ]
     [1127:on a ^N road through the peasant village  and a few ^N people could
     be seen milling about or scrubbing ^N vegetables outside the ^N huts. Some of
     them stopped what they doing to stare silently at ^N Lancelot as he rode
     by]
     [1128:outside
     the ^N serf's ^N gate . The ^N gates were made of ^N wood and had
     evidentally been much patched and repaired over the ^N years]
     [1129:on the ^N road , with untidy ^N verges extending into low ^N heathland]
     [1130:on the ^N road . ^N Lancelot could hear the sound of ^N water from a
     ^N stream or ^N river nearby]
     [1131:on the ^N road . A steep ^N escarpment rose above the ^N road on
     either ^N side, making the ^N atmosphere quite oppressive]
     [1132:on the ^N lawns beside the ^N cathedral . The ^N cathedral was tall
     and inspiring, and looked even taller with its ^N spire extending far
     into the ^N sky from the central ^N tower]
     [1133:outside the ^N cloisters , which was low-roofed, with several
     ^N plants trained to climb over its ^N walls from the ^N ground to the thatched
     ^N roof]
     [1134:on a ^N bridge over the ^N river
     ^N camel . The ^N bridge was a simple ^N structure, with a central ^N arch
     anchoring it to the ^N river ^N bed ]
     [1135:outside the ^N bishop's gate . A finely detailed ^N coat of ^N arms
     was carved in the ^N centre in coloured ^N metal]
     [1136:in ^N Westminster ^N
     meadows and the ^N air was humming with ^N bees, ^N butterflies and






     other ^N insects. In the ^N distance ^N Lancelot could see ^N sheep grazing on the
     ^N pasture by the ^N river]
     [1137:on a ^N straight ^N way . This part of the ^N land didn't appear to
     be farmed at all, but was left fallow]
     [1138:in a ^N garden . It was a riotous ^N tangle of different ^N species of
     ^N plants, all competing for ^N space in the fertile ^N soil]
     [1139:beside ^N castle ^N Meliagaunt , with only the
     narrowest of ^N windows set in the smooth stone ^N walls. It was
     obviously designed with one firm ^N objective - to keep ^N people out]
     ;
     ; grid rooms... ; 1020-1030 is
     grid in part 1
     [1140:in the ^N south ^N warren. The branches were twisted and grew
     thickly, so that it was difficult to cut a path between them]
     [1141:on the ^N south
     ^N way . Isolated ^N spots of straggling ^N vegetation gave some interest
     to
     the ^N surroundings]
     [1142:on the ^N west ^N way . ^N Lancelot could hear ^N birds singing from the
     depths of the ^N trees around him]
     [1143:on the ^N market ^N square . The ^N buildings here were quite large
     and sturdily built, but obscured by untidy ^N stalls and makeshift ^N animal
     ^N pens
     used on ^N market ^N days, which spilled out into the ^N square itself]
     [1144:in the ^N north ^N warren . It smelt damp and faintly decaying,
     and the heavy ^N air seemed to close in on him]
     [1145:on the ^N north ^N way . He could hear the ^N crackling of ^N twigs
     underfoot as he made his ^N way along the overgrown ^N track]
     [1146:on the ^N road outside the mews . Many of the ^N divots made by
     the ^N horses had filled up with ^N water and large ^N puddles had formed in
     ^N places] ; mews object also here
     [1147:on the ^N King's ^N road . Here the ^N ground was easy going, as
     the constant ^N traffic had beaten it into a smooth hard ^N road.
     Flowering ^N bushes lined the ^N track] ;

     [1269:outside Merlin's house, an untidy ^N stone ^N dwelling with a thatched
     ^N roof which appeared to have deposited much of its ^N straw on the
     ^N ground
     beneath it. It was obviously in a state of disrepair. ^N Cobwebs hung
     densely over the ^N windows and it was impossible to see anything through
     these murky ^N holes in the ^N wall. Outside, against the ^N wall, grew a wild
     ^N proliferation of strange ^N plants, none of which ^N Lancelot could begin to
     identify. Most were shooting up abundantly and some had ^N labels attached to
     them with curious ^N writing or ^N symbols on them which ^N Lancelot found he
     could not decipher. The ^N door was low and set deep into the ^N wall. It
     hung slightly askew; indeed it seemed as though it could easily fall
     off its ^N hinges  ]
     [1270:outside the kennels, an untidy collection of huts, with wooden
     props holding up a makeshift roof]
     [1271:outside the stables, a low-slung outhouse made of dark rough
     stone]
