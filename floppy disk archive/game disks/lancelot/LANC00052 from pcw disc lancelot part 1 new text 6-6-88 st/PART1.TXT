     ;
     ; Messages are of the form: [ number : text ] ; comment
     ; They must be in numeric order, but gaps are allowed in the number
     ; sequence, of course.
     ;
     ; | (vertical bar) terminates the printable part of a message. It
     ;   is typed by shifting backslash (to the left of the keyboard).
     ; / forces the following character to be printed literally.
     ; % is carriage return. Note that carriage return is ignored if
     ;   the printing is already at the start of a line, to make coding
     ;   simpler. To force a real carriage return, print space first.
     ; ^ (shift 6) marks a word for recognition by the parser. It is
     ;   followed by a letter for word type:
     ;   Adjective; Comment; conJunction; Noun; Preposition; Verb.
     ;
     ; Capitalization is done automatically on output and you are
     ; recommended to use lower case for the first letter of messages
     ; as this improves compression and will make no difference on
     ; output, providing all punctuation is correct.

     Ganis

     [606:Gawain, a dark-haired knight from the Orkneys. He was small, with
     a restless expression that betrayed rashness. He always looked as though
     he was about to dash off to do battle at a moment's notice] ; Sir
     Gawain
     [607:the Red Knight. He was, as you might expect, dressed entirely in
     red. His spear and shield were red as well, not to mention his cheeks,
     hair and luxuriant beard. A towering fellow, he stood head and
     shoulders above most of his men  ] ; the Red Knight
     [608:Meliot, a small, rather prim-looking knight] ; Sir Meliot

     [609:Lamorak, of Wales. A wiry, small-built knight, he had a
     permanently scowling face] ; Sir Lamorak

     the same broad build and determined face as his brother] ;

     a drak, pointed, almost weaselly looking face] ; Sir Agravain

     from the others] ; Sir Aliduke

     slight tic in one eye. Rather disconcertingly, he was perpetually
     scratching himself] ; Sir Brandiles

     of ginger hair topping a long fuzzy ginger beard] ; Sir Brian
     [615:Geheris, brother of Sir Gawain, and dark like him] ; Sir Geheris
     [616:Gareth, brother of Sir Gawain, a tall broad-shouldered fair young
     man, who looked quite unlike his brothers. Lancelot could not help but
     notice his huge banana-like hands] ; Sir Gareth
     [617:Lionel, Lancelot's young nephew, a nervous-looking man who bit
     his fingernails] ; Sir Lionel
     [618:Marhaus, an older knight with a lined face which told of many
     battles fought and not all of them won] ; Sir Marhaus ;
     [652:some peasants, a motley lot, their faces thick with the grime of
     the farmyard. A strong smell of stables emanated from them. Some were
     clutching small bundles of vegetables and muttered to each other,
     while others chewed passively and stared vacantly into the distance] ;
     peasants






     [653:a crowd gathered to watch the execution, an ill-dressed mob, who
     were also none too clean. They were waiting expectantly for what would
     doubtless be one of the highlights of their year, although a few minor
     scuffles kept breaking out amidst the expectant hush] ; crowd
     [654:a collective of hawks, from which a cacophany of cawing never
     ceased. They were certainly not house-trained, nor even barn-trained,
     and nor were they very tidy in their grooming habits] ; hawks who have
     slept over Lancelot.
     [655:the Queen's knights, holding their spears akimbo. A few exchanged
     pleasantries on the dreadful price of jewelled rings these days, and
     tossed their heads with tinkling laughter] ; Queen's knights
     [656:the Black Knight, a slight and wiry figure, nimble on his feet
     and even more agile on a horse. He cut a daunting figure, with his
     black armour, shield and spear and sleek jet-coloured horse to match]
     ; Black knight (Arthur in disguise).
     [657:Guenever, Arthur's wife. A tall woman, beautiful in a steely,
     high-bred manner. She had a particularly haughty nose, and looked as
     though she wouldn't suffer fools gladly. She was dressed in a gown cut
     with austere simplicity, which only drew attention to the high quality
     of the material, and to her fine figure and stately deportment. Her
     headdress was particularly tall, even allowing for fashion, and beneath
     it her heavy golden tresses could be seen, coiled into a simple knot] ;
     Guenever, Lancelot's love etc.
     [658:Sir Kay, a thin man and not very well-built considering his
     position as a knight. He had an arrogant face, and was fond of ordering
     people about, particularly those who were noticeably more proficient
     than him in a joust. Because he was Arthur's half-brother, he was
     often able to escape rebuke for his impertinence] ; Sir Kay
     [659:Sir Meliagaunt, a tall thin knight, with a hooked nose and
     piercing eyes, which he fixed on different members of the party in
     turn, so that it difficult not to feel nervous in his company] ; Sir Meliagaunt
     [660:Arthur, king of England, although you probably wouldn't pick him
     out as such in a crowd. He was a fresh-faced youth, with an eager
     expression, which lit up at the mention of hunting and honour, and
     died down into little more than forced interest when politics or
     administration were the topics under discussion. His wide brown eyes
     and boyish face and build betrayed his innocence, but he took his
     responsibilities, both as a king and a knight, gravely, and was keen
     and quick to learn the duties of his position] ; Arthur
     [661:Sir Colgreavaunce, a middle-aged knight, much buffeted by past
     quests and battles, with a worn face which bore many scars. He had a
     reputation for recounting endless tales of noble deeds - in which he
     was inevitably the hero - over dinner] ; Sir
     Colgreavaunce
     [662:a fusty old wizard of rather humorous appearance. He wore a dark
     purplish cloak patterned with swirls which seemed to move of their own
     accord and in its many huge pockets strange objects and small animals
     could often be found if a particular piece of sorcery demanded it. His
     long stringy beard was mottled and splodged with unidentifiable
     substances, possibly remnants of potions experimented with and long
     forgotten. Sometimes he muttered to himself incomprehensibly;
     frequently one wondered if he was really aware of his surroundings at
     all] ; Merlin
     [663:a wizened old carter, in turns gloomy and wildly jovial. With
     little prompting, he would tell you his rather dismal life story,
     before suddenly bursting into song. It looked as though he had been at
     the mead] ; carter
     [664:a damosel, with a slight figure and a vivacious face. She had a
     mischievous smile and a habit of shaking her head when she laughed
     which was most disarming] ;

     [755:a bed, a narrow framed cot with a hard mattress] ; Lancelot's bed in Meliagaunt's guest room.

     slept in plenty worse before then. Rustling noises, which were
     probably ticks but could have been mice could be heard from its depths ] ; bed in Mews.

     side and was beginning to dry at the edges] ; Lancelot's blood on Guen's bed.
     [758:some books. It was impossible to read the titles,
     since many of them had lost their spines long ago. All were obviously

     of them, while some looked as though they
     might crumble to dust if touched] ; Merlin's books.
     [759:a cart, made of rough planks nailed together. The loosely-
     attached wheels ensured a bumpy ride] ; cart

     [764:the Round Table, made of solid oak and fashioned like a spokeless
     wheel, so that the knights who sat around it could be served from the

     his siege was in a lowlier position than that of any other knight] ;

     armour there. Heavy drapes covered some of the walls to keep out the
     worst of the draughts, and some hung over dark corridor openings or
     flights of stairs. Lancelot found nothing of interest, so he left
     again]
     [934:in the cloisters, where the monks could be seen earnestly at

     retreated silently]

     [935:in the upstairs rooms of the castle. In the twisting corridors,
     he frequently got lost, or inadvertently doubled back on himself. On
     the whole, the rooms were surprisingly spartan for the court of a
     king, although they were all very spick and span, but the high
     ceilings and narrow slit windows made them extremely draughty.
     Lancelot found nothing of interest, so he returned to the stairs]

     [936:in the downstairs rooms of the castle. The public rooms were vast and
     well-lit by the many flaming torches hanging from the walls, but the
     back rooms were altogether pokier, darker, and smellier. Shouts as






     orders were given and taken, and snatches of jovial conversation
     filtered through some of the heavy oak doors. Occasionally
     he would pass servants or messengers, hurrying through the dim halls.

     protraying a stirring battle ^N scene hung on the ^N wall ]
     [1101:in the ^N study , with which Lancelot could discern an old
     ^N armchair, sprouting with ^N horsehair and a number of ^N books piled
     untidily on the ^N floor around it ]
     [1102:in ^N Merlin's ^N library . Some of them had spilled over the
     ^N furniture, and burned away the ^N fabric, while others gave off strange
     ^N smoke. ^N Skins and ^N heads of ^N animals were hanging on the ^N walls, doubtless
     to be used for ^N Merlin's ^N experiments, and curiously fashioned ^N pieces of
     smooth ^N wood were suspended from ^N hooks set into the ^N ceiling. In one

     found that his every ^N footstep echoed around the ^N pillars and up into
     the ^N rafters]
     [1114:before the ^N altar . A great ^N tapestry hung heavily on the ^N wall
     behind it and the ^N altar ^N table seemed flooded with ^N light from the

     gate . A small tidy ^N hedge marked out the ^N limits of the ^N path]
     [1116:in ^N Guenever's ^N boudoir . A couple of rich silken ^N dresses
     were folded neatly over a ^N chest, and still more ^N finery could be seen
     spilling out of a wide ^N cupboard]
     [1117:in the ^N royal ^N
     suite . The ^N bed in particular was enormous, with a richly decorated
     ^N cover of purple ^N samite]
     [1118:in the ^N guest ^N suite . A large ^N display of wild ^N flowers in a
     ^N pot on the ^N window ^N seat gave the ^N room a fresh welcoming ^N smell]
     [1119:on the ^N stairs , but where the ^N stone was smooth, the ^N steps had
     been ground to a fine ^N polish and almost shone]
     [1120:in the ^N prison . The only ^N light came from a tiny ^N window,
     heavily barred, set high up against the ^N ceiling, while a thin smattering
     of dirty ^N straw covered the ^N floor ]
     [1121:in ^N Meliagaunt's ^N hall  in the ^N draught which blew in from
     the open ^N windows. Some of the ^N wall ^N torches had already gone out, which
     made it difficult to see into the ^N shadows of the ^N room]

     ^N track into a deeper ^N pool beyond]

     a ^N road , comprising of a mixture of ^N crops and ^N sheep grazing. He
     could spot a few bent-over ^N figures of ^N farmworkers in the ^N fields ]
     [1127:on a ^N road through the peasant village  and a few ^N people could
     be seen milling about or scrubbing ^N vegetables outside the ^N huts. Some of
     them stopped what they doing to stare silently at ^N Lancelot as he rode
     by]
     [1128:outside
     the ^N serf's ^N gate . The ^N gates were made of ^N wood and had
     evidentally been much patched and repaired over the ^N years]

     [1130:on the ^N road . ^N Lancelot could hear the sound of ^N water from a
     ^N stream or ^N river nearby]
     [1131:on the ^N road . A steep ^N escarpment rose above the ^N road on
     either ^N side, making the ^N atmosphere quite oppressive]
     [1132:on the ^N lawns beside the ^N cathedral . The ^N cathedral was tall
     and inspiring, and looked even taller with its ^N spire extending far
     into the ^N sky from the central ^N tower]
     [1133:outside the ^N cloisters , which was low-roofed, with several
     ^N plants trained to climb over its ^N walls from the ^N ground to the thatched
     ^N roof]
     [1134:on a ^N bridge over the ^N river
     ^N camel . The ^N bridge was a simple ^N structure, with a central ^N arch
     anchoring it to the ^N river ^N bed ]
     [1135:outside the ^N bishop's gate . A finely detailed ^N coat of ^N arms
     was carved in the ^N centre in coloured ^N metal]
     [1136:in ^N Westminster ^N
     meadows and the ^N air was humming with ^N bees, ^N butterflies and






     other ^N insects. In the ^N distance ^N Lancelot could see ^N sheep grazing on the
     ^N pasture by the ^N river]
     [1137:on a ^N straight ^N way . This part of the ^N land didn't appear to
     be farmed at all, but was left fallow]
     [1138:in a ^N garden . It was a riotous ^N tangle of different ^N species of
     ^N plants, all competing for ^N space in the fertile ^N soil]
     [1139:beside ^N castle ^N Meliagaunt , with only the
     narrowest of ^N windows set in the smooth stone ^N walls. It was
     obviously designed with one firm ^N objective - to keep ^N people out]

     thickly, so that it was difficult to cut a path between them]

     ^N way . Isolated ^N spots of straggling ^N vegetation gave some interest
     to
     the ^N surroundings]
     [1142:on the ^N west ^N way . ^N Lancelot could hear ^N birds singing from the
     depths of the ^N trees around him]
     [1143:on the ^N market ^N square . The ^N buildings here were quite large
     and sturdily built, but obscured by untidy ^N stalls and makeshift ^N animal
     ^N pens
     used on ^N market ^N days, which spilled out into the ^N square itself]
     [1144:in the ^N north ^N warren . It smelt damp and faintly decaying,
     and the heavy ^N air seemed to close in on him]
     [1145:on the ^N north ^N way . He could hear the ^N crackling of ^N twigs
     underfoot as he made his ^N way along the overgrown ^N track]
     [1146:on the ^N road outside the mews . Many of the ^N divots made by
     the ^N horses had filled up with ^N water and large ^N puddles had formed in
     ^N places] ; mews object also here
     [1147:on the ^N King's ^N road . Here the ^N ground was easy going, as
     the constant ^N traffic had beaten it into a smooth hard ^N road.
     Flowering ^N bushes lined the ^N track] ;

     [1269:outside Merlin's house, an untidy ^N stone ^N dwelling with a thatched
     ^N roof which appeared to have deposited much of its ^N straw on the
     ^N ground
     beneath it. It was obviously in a state of disrepair. ^N Cobwebs hung
     densely over the ^N windows and it was impossible to see anything through
     these murky ^N holes in the ^N wall. Outside, against the ^N wall, grew a wild
     ^N proliferation of strange ^N plants, none of which ^N Lancelot could begin to
     identify. Most were shooting up abundantly and some had ^N labels attached to
     them with curious ^N writing or ^N symbols on them which ^N Lancelot found he
     could not decipher. The ^N door was low and set deep into the ^N wall. It
     hung slightly askew; indeed it seemed as though it could easily fall
     off its ^N hinges  ]
     [1270:outside the kennels, an untidy collection of huts, with wooden
     props holding up a makeshift roof]

     [1352:in ^N Merlin's ^N library . Lancelot accidentally brushed one of
     the phials with his arm, and there was a loud 'pop', as a cloud of
     dense purplish smoke burst out of the bottle into the room]
     [1353:on ^N Merlin's ^N stairs. Lancelot wondered if they would stand
     his weight]
     [1354:in the ^N mews. ]
     [1355:in the ^N stables . There was a quick clatter of hooves as one of
     the horses pawed the ground impatiently]
     [1356:in the ^N kennels . and felt a wet nose thrust itself into his
     face]
     [1357:in the ^N hall containing the ^N Round ^N Table . Although it was
     empty now, Lancelot could well imagine the jovial atmopshere of the
     hall when it was filled with knights returned weary but triumphant
     from quests, recounting their adventures replete with food and wine]
     [1358:in Lancelot's ^N bedchamber ]
     [1359:in Guenever's ^N bedchamber ]
     [1360:on the ^N stairs . Lancelot felt as though everyone in the
     castle must be able to hear him]
     [1361:in Arthur's ^N hall in the ^N castle . A couple of logs fell
     out of the fire on to the hearth, with a crackling noise, which made
     Lancelot jump]
     [1362:inside the ^N Serf's ^N gate . Two young urchins turned and
     pointed at Lancelot, calling out something obscene before running away
     with yelps of laughter]
     [1363:in the ^N cathedral]
     [1364:before the ^N altar . A sense of spiritual well-being filled
     Lancelot]
     [1365:inside the ^N Bishop's ^N gate]
     [1366:in ^N Guenever's ^N boudoir . Even though Guenever was the Queen,
     he was surprised at the opulence of the surroundings compared with the
     other rooms in the castle]
     [1367:in the ^N royal ^N suite . ]
     [1368:in the ^N guest ^N suite ]
     [1369:on the ^N stairs  and Lancelot nearly missed his footing once or
     twice]
     [1370:in the ^N prison, a small dark cell . A rat poked a long pointed
     nose out of a dark corner and sat looking at Lancelot, twitching
     uneasily]
     [1371:in ^N Meliagaunt's ^N hall]

     ; outside rooms for part 1...
     [1374:on a ^N forest ^N road He could hear the rustling of some large
     wild animal in the undergrowth]
     [1375:wading through the ^N ford . Lancelot could feel cold water
     seeping in through the joints in his armour]
     [1376:on a ^N road . Women were bent double in the fields, tending to
     the crops]
     [1377:on a ^N road through the peasant village . A small and very dirty
     child ran alongside him for some time before being called inside by an
     older woman]
     [1378:outside the ^N serf's ^N gate . A man coming in the opposite






     direction
     coughed and spat copiously towards Lancelot as he passed him]
     [1379:on the ^N road and Lancelot was slowed down as his horse
     carefully picked its way between the holes]
     [1380:on the ^N road. ]
     [1381:on the ^N road . A twig snapped back and caught Lancelot in the
     face, so he pulled down the front of his visor for protection]
     [1382:on the ^N lawns beside the ^N cathedral . Someone here was
     obviously a keen gardener]
     [1383:outside the ^N cloisters . ]
     [1384:on a ^N bridge over the ^N river ^N camel. Lancelot dropped a
     small stone into the river and judged, from the sound that it made,
     that the water was surprisingly deep]
     [1385:outside the ^N bishop's gate ]
     [1386:in ^N Westminster ^N meadows . The sun was warm on his armour

     him, Lancelot saw a fine specimen of a boar break cover and gallop
     across the road, but he had other things to think about than hunting
     at the moment]
     [1393:on the ^N market ^N square . A pathetically thin woman lurched
     towards Lancelot, her hands outstretched, begging him for food, but
     turned away resignedly as he showed her that he had none with him]
     [1394:in the ^N north ^N warren . Lancelot hoped that he wouldn't come
     out covered in leeches]

     and prepared to take his leave of her]
     [1501:Lancelot was knighted by
     Arthur, who insisted that he stay and dine with them. As they sat
     through the meal, and the drinks flowed, Lancelot kept stealing
     glances across at Queen Guenever. Truly, he thought, she was a
     beautiful and stately woman. And as the meal wore on, he realized he
     was falling in love with her.% Once or twice he caught Guenever
     casting him sidelong looks in return, almost coyly, and eventually,
     feeling like a small boy, he plucked up the courage to ask to be her
     champion. As he had feared, she refused to consider being championed
     by a novice, and for a dreadful moment Lancelot thought she would






     rebuff him entirely.%
     But then Guenever smiled knowingly at him and invited him to return to
     her when he had proved himself to be worthy of her patronage. At this,
     Lancelot felt a huge swell of pride and promised he would not fail
     her, but would go to Logris without delay, there to honour Guenever
     with noble deeds and battles chivalrously won.%
     Then Arthur looked up from his plate and looked at Lancelot. "I tell
     you one thing you could do. There are some knights of mine - all
     honourable fellows of the Round Table here - who are being held
     captive by these rebel lords who seem to think they own the place.
     Now, if you could bring some of them back to Camelot as free men, that
     would make you pretty worthy of anyone, for a start."]
     [1515:the black knight sat straight and proud on his horse and
     challenged Lancelot, "Squire, no man can pass this way, unless I allow
     them to. You must prove yourself before you may cross
     this ford". ]
     [1516:Lancelot walked further towards Camelot, the great castle
     seemingly growing in size and majesty every time he looked up. He
     spurred on his horse, anxious to reach it as quickly as possible]
     [1517:Lancelot was now walking through the village outside the city of
     Camelot. It was untidy and bedraggled compared to the ordered contours
     of the walls surrounding the court ]
     [1518:Lancelot was amazed by the size of the huge wall
     around Camelot. The top seemed to stretch right into the sky ]
