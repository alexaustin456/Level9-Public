     [1351:in the ^N study. ]
     [1352:in ^N Merlin's ^N library . Lancelot accidentally brushed one of
     the phials with his arm, and there was a loud 'pop', as a cloud of
     dense purplish smoke burst out of the bottle into the room]
     [1353:on ^N Merlin's ^N stairs. Lancelot wondered if they would stand
     his weight]
     [1354:in the ^N mews. ]
     [1355:in the ^N stables . There was a quick clatter of hooves as one of
     the horses pawed the ground impatiently]
     [1356:in the ^N kennels . and felt a wet nose thrust itself into his
     face]
     [1357:in the ^N hall containing the ^N Round ^N Table . Although it was
     empty now, Lancelot could well imagine the jovial atmopshere of the
     hall when it was filled with knights returned weary but triumphant
     from quests, recounting their adventures replete with food and wine]
     [1358:in Lancelot's ^N bedchamber ]
     [1359:in Guenever's ^N bedchamber ]
     [1360:on the ^N stairs . Lancelot felt as though everyone in the
     castle must be able to hear him]
     [1361:in Arthur's ^N hall in the ^N castle . A couple of logs fell
     out of the fire on to the hearth, with a crackling noise, which made
     Lancelot jump]
     [1362:inside the ^N Serf's ^N gate . Two young urchins turned and
     pointed at Lancelot, calling out something obscene before running away
     with yelps of laughter]
     [1363:in the ^N cathedral]
     [1364:before the ^N altar . A sense of spiritual well-being filled
     Lancelot]
     [1365:inside the ^N Bishop's ^N gate]
     [1366:in ^N Guenever's ^N boudoir . Even though Guenever was the Queen,
     he was surprised at the opulence of the surroundings compared with the
     other rooms in the castle]
     [1367:in the ^N royal ^N suite . ]
     [1368:in the ^N guest ^N suite ]
     [1369:on the ^N stairs  and Lancelot nearly missed his footing once or
     twice]
     [1370:in the ^N prison, a small dark cell . A rat poked a long pointed
     nose out of a dark corner and sat looking at Lancelot, twitching
     uneasily]
     [1371:in ^N Meliagaunt's ^N hall]

     ; outside rooms for part 1...
     [1374:on a ^N forest ^N road He could hear the rustling of some large
     wild animal in the undergrowth]
     [1375:wading through the ^N ford . Lancelot could feel cold water
     seeping in through the joints in his armour]
     [1376:on a ^N road . Women were bent double in the fields, tending to
     the crops]
     [1377:on a ^N road through the peasant village . A small and very dirty
     child ran alongside him for some time before being called inside by an
     older woman]
     [1378:outside the ^N serf's ^N gate . A man coming in the opposite






     direction
     coughed and spat copiously towards Lancelot as he passed him]
     [1379:on the ^N road and Lancelot was slowed down as his horse
     carefully picked its way between the holes]
     [1380:on the ^N road. ]
     [1381:on the ^N road . A twig snapped back and caught Lancelot in the
     face, so he pulled down the front of his visor for protection]
     [1382:on the ^N lawns beside the ^N cathedral . Someone here was
     obviously a keen gardener]
     [1383:outside the ^N cloisters . ]
     [1384:on a ^N bridge over the ^N river ^N camel. Lancelot dropped a

     [1390:in the ^N south ^N warren]
     [1391:on the ^N south ^N way]
     [1392:on the ^N west ^N way . From out of a cluster of bushes ahead of
     him, Lancelot saw a fine specimen of a boar break cover and gallop
     across the road, but he had other things to think about than hunting
     at the moment]
     [1393:on the ^N market ^N square . A pathetically thin woman lurched
     towards Lancelot, her hands outstretched, begging him for food, but
     turned away resignedly as he showed her that he had none with him]

     ;; [1403:on a lake. The water was glassily still and so dark that he
     could not begin to guess at its depth]
     ;; [1404:on a rock, warm with the heat of the sun on the hillside. Valleys covered
     with thick dark woodland were spread out below him]

     white lipped ridges]

     [1499:Lancelot said goodbye to Guenever sadly
     and prepared to take his leave of her]
     [1501:Lancelot was knighted by
     Arthur, who insisted that he stay and dine with them. As they sat
     through the meal, and the drinks flowed, Lancelot kept stealing
     glances across at Queen Guenever. Truly, he thought, she was a
     beautiful and stately woman. And as the meal wore on, he realized he
     was falling in love with her.% Once or twice he caught Guenever
     casting him sidelong looks in return, almost coyly, and eventually,
     feeling like a small boy, he plucked up the courage to ask to be her
     champion. As he had feared, she refused to consider being championed
     by a novice, and for a dreadful moment Lancelot thought she would






     rebuff him entirely.%
     But then Guenever smiled knowingly at him and invited him to return to
     her when he had proved himself to be worthy of her patronage. At this,
     Lancelot felt a huge swell of pride and promised he would not fail
     her, but would go to Logris without delay, there to honour Guenever
     with noble deeds and battles chivalrously won.%
     Then Arthur looked up from his plate and looked at Lancelot. "I tell
     you one thing you could do. There are some knights of mine - all
     honourable fellows of the Round Table here - who are being held
     captive by these rebel lords who seem to think they own the place.
     Now, if you could bring some of them back to Camelot as free men, that
     would make you pretty worthy of anyone, for a start."]
     [1515:the black knight sat straight and proud on his horse and
     challenged Lancelot, "Squire, no man can pass this way, unless I allow
     them to. You must prove yourself before you may cross
     this ford". ]
     [1516:Lancelot walked further towards Camelot, the great castle
     seemingly growing in size and majesty every time he looked up. He
     spurred on his horse, anxious to reach it as quickly as possible]
     [1517:Lancelot was now walking through the village outside the city of
     Camelot. It was untidy and bedraggled compared to the ordered contours
     of the walls surrounding the court ]
     [1518:Lancelot was amazed by the size of the huge wall
     around Camelot. The top seemed to stretch right into the sky ]
     ;
     ; room 180 is message printed about Queen's
     capture by Meliagaunt

     [1530:Lancelot found the queen was missing.
     However, there were marks on the ground which indicated that a great struggle
     had recently taken place and he found he was caught up in a determined
     melee of people marching southwards. ]
