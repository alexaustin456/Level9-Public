     ; Messages are of the form: [ number : text ] ; comment
     ; They must be in numeric order, but gaps are allowed in the number
     ; sequence, of course.
     ;
     ; | (vertical bar) terminates the printable part of a message. It
     ;   is typed by shifting backslash (to the left of the keyboard).
     ; / forces the following character to be printed literally.
     ; % is carriage return. Note that carriage return is ignored if
     ;   the printing is already at the start of a line, to make coding
     ;   simpler. To force a real carriage return, print space first.
     ; ^ (shift 6) marks a word for recognition by the parser. It is
     ;   followed by a letter for word type:
     ;   Adjective; Comment; conJunction; Noun; Preposition; Verb.
     ;
     ; Capitalization is done automatically on output and you are
     ; recommended to use lower case for the first letter of messages
     ; as this improves compression and will make no difference on
     ; output, providing all punctuation is correct.
