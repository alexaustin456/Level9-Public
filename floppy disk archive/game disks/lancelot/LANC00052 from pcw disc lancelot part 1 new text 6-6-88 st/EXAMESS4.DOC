     ;
     [601:a brave and fearless knight. His face was already lined, despite
     his youth, and full of
     character, and he had an air of confidence - perhaps over-confidence.
     Clad in his armour, which was still a bit stiff at the joints with new
     ness and chafed a bit, he looked eager and ready to take on any
     challenge] ; Lancelot
     [602:Tristram, a fair-faced, slightly girlish-looking knight. He had
     long, sensitive fingers which were greatly-renowned for their prowess with
     the harp and handling hawks. His armour shone and was barely marked,
     while the ever-present harp was slung over his shoulder ] ; Tristram
     [603:Galahad, a young slim Adonis of a fellow. This young man was obviously going
     places. He had the fair looks and wide blue eyes to turn any damosel's head, and there
     was an air of success about him, almost an aura, which could not be
     attributed simply to his shield and breastplate, which shone as though
     the sun was directed straight on to it   ] ; Galahad
     [604:Bors de Ganis, a solid, dependable, wooden man] ; Sir Bors de
     Ganis
     [605:Sir Question Mark, a cantankerous old fellow, bluff and hearty] ; Sir Question Mark
     [606:Gawain, a dark-haired knight from the Orkneys. He was small, with
     a restless expression that betrayed rashness. He always looked as though
     he was about to dash off to do battle at a moment's notice] ; Sir
     Gawain
     [607:the Red Knight. He was, as you might expect, dressed entirely in
     red. His spear and shield were red as well, not to mention his cheeks,
     hair and luxuriant beard. A towering fellow, he stood head and
     shoulders above most of his men  ] ; the Red Knight
     [608:Meliot, a small, rather prim-looking knight] ; Sir Meliot

     [609:Lamorak, of Wales. A wiry, small-built knight, he had a
     permanently scowling face] ; Sir Lamorak
     [610:Ector de Maris, brother of Lancelot, a sturdy, loyal knight, with
     the same broad build and determined face as his brother] ;
     Sir Ector de Maris

     [611:Agravain, brother of Sir Gawain, a thin man with
     a drak, pointed, almost weaselly looking face] ; Sir Agravain
     [612:Aliduke, a towerlingly strong knight, who stood somewhat aloof
     from the others] ; Sir Aliduke

     [613:Brandiles, a lop-sided looking man, with a broken nose and a
     slight tic in one eye. Rather disconcertingly, he was perpetually
     scratching himself] ; Sir Brandiles
     [614:Brian, a huge man, with legs like tree trunks and a thick thatch
     of ginger hair topping a long fuzzy ginger beard] ; Sir Brian
     [615:Geheris, brother of Sir Gawain, and dark like him] ; Sir Geheris
     [616:Gareth, brother of Sir Gawain, a tall broad-shouldered fair young
     man, who looked quite unlike his brothers. Lancelot could not help but
     notice his huge banana-like hands] ; Sir Gareth
     [617:Lionel, Lancelot's young nephew, a nervous-looking man who bit
     his fingernails] ; Sir Lionel
     [618:Marhaus, an older knight with a lined face which told of many
     battles fought and not all of them won] ; Sir Marhaus ;
     [652:some peasants, a motley lot, their faces thick with the grime of
     the farmyard. A strong smell of stables emanated from them. Some were
     clutching small bundles of vegetables and muttered to each other,
     while others chewed passively and stared vacantly into the distance] ;
     peasants






     [653:a crowd gathered to watch the execution, an ill-dressed mob, who
     were also none too clean. They were waiting expectantly for what would
     doubtless be one of the highlights of their year, although a few minor
     scuffles kept breaking out amidst the expectant hush] ; crowd
     [654:a collective of hawks, from which a cacophany of cawing never
     ceased. They were certainly not house-trained, nor even barn-trained,
     and nor were they very tidy in their grooming habits] ; hawks who have
     slept over Lancelot.
     [655:the Queen's knights, holding their spears akimbo. A few exchanged
     pleasantries on the dreadful price of jewelled rings these days, and
     tossed their heads with tinkling laughter] ; Queen's knights
     [656:the Black Knight, a slight and wiry figure, nimble on his feet
     and even more agile on a horse. He cut a daunting figure, with his
     black armour, shield and spear and sleek jet-coloured horse to match]
     ; Black knight (Arthur in disguise).
     [657:Guenever, Arthur's wife. A tall woman, beautiful in a steely,
     high-bred manner. She had a particularly haughty nose, and looked as
     though she wouldn't suffer fools gladly. She was dressed in a gown cut
     with austere simplicity, which only drew attention to the high quality
     of the material, and to her fine figure and stately deportment. Her
     headdress was particularly tall, even allowing for fashion, and beneath
     it her heavy golden tresses could be seen, coiled into a simple knot] ;
     Guenever, Lancelot's love etc.
     [658:Sir Kay, a thin man and not very well-built considering his
     position as a knight. He had an arrogant face, and was fond of ordering
     people about, particularly those who were noticeably more proficient
     than him in a joust. Because he was Arthur's half-brother, he was
     often able to escape rebuke for his impertinence] ; Sir Kay
     [659:Sir Meliagaunt, a tall thin knight, with a hooked nose and
     piercing eyes, which he fixed on different members of the party in
     turn, so that it difficult not to feel nervous in his company] ; Sir Meliagaunt
     [660:Arthur, king of England, although you probably wouldn't pick him
     out as such in a crowd. He was a fresh-faced youth, with an eager
     expression, which lit up at the mention of hunting and honour, and
     died down into little more than forced interest when politics or
     administration were the topics under discussion. His wide brown eyes
     and boyish face and build betrayed his innocence, but he took his
     responsibilities, both as a king and a knight, gravely, and was keen
     and quick to learn the duties of his position] ; Arthur
     [661:Sir Colgreavaunce, a middle-aged knight, much buffeted by past
     quests and battles, with a worn face which bore many scars. He had a
     reputation for recounting endless tales of noble deeds - in which he
     was inevitably the hero - over dinner] ; Sir
     Colgreavaunce
     [662:a fusty old wizard of rather humorous appearance. He wore a dark
     purplish cloak patterned with swirls which seemed to move of their own
     accord and in its many huge pockets strange objects and small animals
     could often be found if a particular piece of sorcery demanded it. His
     long stringy beard was mottled and splodged with unidentifiable
     substances, possibly remnants of potions experimented with and long
     forgotten. Sometimes he muttered to himself incomprehensibly;
     frequently one wondered if he was really aware of his surroundings at
     all] ; Merlin
     [663:a wizened old carter, in turns gloomy and wildly jovial. With
     little prompting, he would tell you his rather dismal life story,
     before suddenly bursting into song. It looked as though he had been at
     the mead] ; carter
     [664:a damosel, with a slight figure and a vivacious face. She had a
     mischievous smile and a habit of shaking her head when she laughed
     which was most disarming] ;






     Meliagaunt's damosel ;
     ; More examine messages, for moveable objects
     (70..79)...
     [670:a footstool. It was a sturdy wooden stool with little ornament,
     solidly made with four squat legs and a flat wooden seat] ;
     footstool in Guen's bedroom .
     [671:some gloves, made of leather which had darkened and hardened with
     age] ; gloves, worn to hide Lancelot's injury.
     [672:a hat of cloth of red and green arranged in a quartered pattern.
     A pair of antlers protruded from the top and set in the middle of them
     were a couple of bright blue peacock's feathers] ; silly hat.

     ; More examine messages, for static objects (150..169)...
     [750:some bars. They were strong and solid, made of thick wood and set
     only a few inches apart from each other] ; bars of window
     [751:a bed, comprised of a wide shallow mattress on a simple wooden
     frame] ; Guenever's bed in Castle Meliagaunt.
     [752:a bed, luxurious and soft, surrounded by knick-knacks and
     surrounded by hangings of rich samite] ; Guenever's bed in the royal castle.
     [753:a bed. A sturdy functional frame with a firm mattress laid on
     top. A couple of
     clean blankets sufficed as covers] ; Lancelot's bed in the royal guest room.
     [754:a bed, which was obviously very old. One leg was missing and that
     corner was propped up with books. Horsehair leaked from the mattress] ; Merlin's guest bed.
     [755:a bed, a narrow framed cot with a hard mattress] ; Lancelot's bed in Meliagaunt's guest room.
     [756:a bed of straw. It was none too comfortable, but Lancelot had
     slept in plenty worse before then. Rustling noises, which were
     probably ticks but could have been mice could be heard from its depths ] ; bed in Mews.
     [757:a blood stain. It covered much of the top half of the bed on one
     side and was beginning to dry at the edges] ; Lancelot's blood on Guen's bed.
     [758:some books. It was impossible to read the titles,
     since many of them had lost their spines long ago. All were obviously
     well-thumbed, and pages of scrawled notes had been inserted into many
     of them, while some looked as though they
     might crumble to dust if touched] ; Merlin's books.
     [759:a cart, made of rough planks nailed together. The loosely-
     attached wheels ensured a bumpy ride] ; cart
     [760:a chest, made of oak, and a couple of feet high. The heavy lid opened from
     the top, but the catch looked as though it hadn't been used for some
     time] ; clothes chest
     [761:a ladder, old but serviceable with all its rungs intact] ; ladder
     below Meliagaunt's window
     [762:a pyre, or rather an untidy mound of dry sticks lashed together.
     They would have set up a raging fire in no time at all] ; pyre for Guenever
     [763:some seats showing the names of knights as yet still captive in
     gold lettering. Some of the letters were bright and shining, while
     others appeared to be dimmer, or slightly tarnished] ; sieges around Round Table
     [764:the Round Table, made of solid oak and fashioned like a spokeless
     wheel, so that the knights who sat around it could be served from the
     inside of the rim. When all were seated, no knight could complain that
     his siege was in a lowlier position than that of any other knight] ;
     Round Table
     [765:a
     barred window, high up on the castle wall. Nothing could be discerned
     inside the room from the ground] ; window of Meliagaunt's castle

     ; More examine messages, for invisible objects (170 onwards)...
     [770:some hawk droppings fouling Lancelot's armour. They looked much as
     you might expect bird droppings to appear] ; hawk droppings
     ;

     you might expect bird droppings to appear] ; ha
