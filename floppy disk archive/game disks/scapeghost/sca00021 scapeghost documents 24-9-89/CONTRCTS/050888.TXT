Dear Pete and Sandra, 

                     As promised, I enclose a cheque for #500 in 
respect of your game, "Things that go Bump.." 

I found myself in the awkward position of wanting to produce a game 
with a ghost as hero, but with the redesign of "..Bump.." indefinitely 
postponed and the danger of being misunderstood if I designed a game 
myself on a similar subject. 

I'm glad we could agree a price for me to use the subject. 

The resulting adventure will be out early next year, probably called 
"Spook", and I'll credit both of you with the "original concept". 


                     I want to be fair though, and while #500 seems 
reasonable for a concept, it's not much for a design. 

So, as I expect that "Spook" will turn out quite a bit different to 
the game that "..Bump.." might have become, we'll keep the right to 
use the concept but allow you to use the design. 

You may produce another game based on the original, provided it is 
not launched until 9 months after "Spook" (planned for Feb 89) and 
avoids borrowing new ideas from it.  


                     I hope this is OK and will keep in touch as 
"Spook" progresses. I will of course be interested to see any further 
concepts or designs that you may produce in future. 

                      Best wishes, 


                                  Pete Austin
