This clue sheet starts with alphabetical lists for each of the three 
parts of "Scapeghost". 

Each part has General Hints, Objects/Ghosts and Places. Look down the 
appropriate list to find what you want to know about, then turn to 
the entries whose numbers follow, in brackets. 

If you want to find something, use the number after "where". For 
details of it, use the number after "dtl" (details). 

For example, if you want to know about the Pebble in part 1, look at 
its entry, 119. For details, look up the number after "dtl" and turn 
to entry 680. This gives very brief information and refers you to 670 
for more. And so on..
