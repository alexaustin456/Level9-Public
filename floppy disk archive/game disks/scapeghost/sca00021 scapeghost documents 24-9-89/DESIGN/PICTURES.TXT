Cover picture:

 Ornate Victorian graveyard in the background, cluttered with a 
 variety of funerary architecture: gravestones, crosses, urns, 
 mausoleums, great stone blocks with railings around etc. With a 
 gravel path and maybe a yew tree or two. 

 Of importance to the game is a battered workman's hut in the far 
 background. 

 In the foreground, a 50s detective (as popularised in the 
 Singing Detective, but not fat like Michael Gambon), perhaps 
 leaning against the trunk of a yew with one hand raised to hold 
 the cigarette he is smoking. Grey trenchcoat, brim of floppy hat 
 virtually concealing face. 
 
 To show he's a ghost, the central figure might start to fade away 
 at the waist, becoming totally transparent by the time his feet 
 are reached. I'd like his face to just be a shadow, but there 
 should be something different with his eyes - glowing red coals? 

 The picture must be atmospheric, but not too dark. If it's getting 
 too sludgy, I don't even mind if you add a sprinkling of snow.
