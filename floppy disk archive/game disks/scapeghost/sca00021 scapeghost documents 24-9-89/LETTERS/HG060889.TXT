Level 9 - premier adventure house - have released their last 
adventure (see separate release) and in future will concentrate on 
producing both original and third party games, using their new 
authoring system, the "wHolly Universal Games Engine" (H.U.G.E). 

"H.U.G.E is a good name for the new Level 9 system," commented 
Managing Director Mike Austin, "as it includes 165,000 lines of 
code and has taken 10 man years to develop. It represents a number 
of major advances for games software, and we are confident that 
the acclaim that Level 9 have received in the past for our high 
quality adventures will be continued in the more arcade-orientated 
environment of H.U.G.E". 

Written exclusively for 16-bit computers: IBM PC, Amiga, Atari ST, 
and Macintosh, H.U.G.E is a breakthrough tool for game programming, 
allowing not only unprecedented 3D animation and scrolling, but 
simultaneous development across all systems. 

Features include: 

    Smooth multi-directional scrolling 
    Fast animation, with no overhead for 3D graphics  
    Flexible sprites and Sprite parking 
    IBM graphics on CGA,EGA,MCGA,Hercules,Tandy and 256 colour modes 
    Digitised sound 
    Compression of graphics, code and data etc. 
    Total portability. 


"H.U.G.E has taken a colossal amount of work," remarked Creative 
Director Pete Austin, "and it means Level 9 now have the single 
most powerful and versatile programming tool available today - 
something recognised by every publisher to whom we have demonstrated 
the system to date. All I can say is, watch this H.U.G.E space!" 

Level 9 have already been commissioned to write a number of games 
using the system by a major US publisher, and negotiations with 
further companies are in progress.
