Scapeghost, Level 9's long-awaited new adventure, is now ready 
after being in development for about a year. 

Scapeghost is packaged in one of these truncated A5-ish boxes 
that seem to be the current fashion (185mm x 150mm x 25mm), 
with our instantly recognisable border of L9s on the front - 
and screen shots etc on the back. 

It was the main game on our stand at the recent PC show (with the 
promise that versions would be in stock by the end of the month), 
where reaction was very good - especially to the graphics. 



Scapeghost costs #19.95 for 16-bit and 3" disk versions, and #14.95 
for other 8-bit versions. The full list is..         rrp dispatched

 AMIGA,ST,IBM PC,PCW/CPC/Spectrum+3 disks with pics: #19.95 11th

 CBM 64,BBC 48K/Master disks with pictures:          #14.95 18th 
 Atari XL/XE disk (text only):                       #14.95 18th 
 Spectrum,CBM 64,CPC,Atari XL/XE tapes (text only)   #14.95 18th

Notes. IBM version includes both 5.25" AND 3.5" disks in the box. 
       PCW/CPC/Spectrum+3 disk works on all these 3" disk micros. 
       Tape versions have 3 cassettes in the box. 

To order, please 'phone John Austin on the number above left. 
16-bit and 3" disk versions will be dispatched this Wednesday; 
the rest one week later. 
       


Game summary. In Scapeghost, you play a ghostly ex-detective, 
seeking revenge after being falsely blamed while the real criminals 
go free. 

Even with your old detective skills, your growing psychic powers, 
and the help of kindred spirits, unravelling the mystery isn't 
easy. But the sophisticated Level 9 parser, with advanced features 
such as GO TO, FIND and UNDO, gives you much more than the ghost 
of a chance. 

                      Yours sincerely, 


                                      Pete Austin
