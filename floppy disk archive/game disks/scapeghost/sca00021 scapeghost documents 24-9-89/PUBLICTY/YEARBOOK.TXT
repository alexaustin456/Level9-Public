Arcade Game (yes, "Arcade Game") programmers for 16-bit micros and 
games consoles. Our in-house authoring system H.U.G.E (wHolly 
Universal Games Engine) is a breakthrough tool for game programming, 
allowing not only unprecedented 3D animation and data compression, 
but total portability between ST, Amiga, IBM PC, Macintosh etc. 

Level 9 have already been commissioned to write a number of games 
using the H.U.G.E system by a major US firm, and will be happy to 
discuss programming games for other publishers too.
