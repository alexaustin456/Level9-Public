; ST version of MESSAGE.TXT: messages/keywords for the game. 
; 
; Messages are of the form: [ number : text ] ; comment 
; They must be in numeric order, but gaps are allowed in the number 
; sequence, of course. 
; 
; | (vertical bar) terminates the printable part of a message. It 
;   is typed by shifting backslash (to the left of the keyboard). 
; / forces the following character to be printed literally. 
; % is carriage return. Note that carriage return is ignored if 
;   the printing is already at the start of a line, to make coding 
;   simpler. To force a real carriage return, print space first. 
; ^ (shift 6) marks a word for recognition by the parser. It is 
;   followed by a letter for word type: 
;   Adjective; Comment; conJunction; Noun; Preposition; Verb. 
; 
; Capitalization is done automatically on output and you are 
; recommended to use lower case for the first letter of messages 
; as this improves compression and will make no difference on 
; output, providing all punctuation is correct. 
; 
; Please ensure that all long room descriptions and first-time 
; messages are there. Comment blank msgs..  ;; [1375:] ; etc.. 
; Please comment all long room descriptions, first-time messages, 
; examine messages etc so we know what they refer to. e.g: 
; [1115:, which was very greasy] ; in the kitchen. 
; Exits must be clear from room descriptions or first-time msgs. 

;>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
;>> NB: Grouped messages which lie in unusual areas (e.g. 2500-2799) >>

[5000:concentrating hard, I managed to summon up a vision of past

as my figure returned inside the house again|^N ID]

growth of herbs] 
; 
[5021:at first, the vision showed me busy doing something over 
at the herb garden - though it was too far away for me to see 
what had gone on. As I watched, my figure crossed back again, 
through the front garden and into the house] 
; 
[5024:I began to feel distressed, as if something violent had happened 
here in the past, though nothing showed in my vision]

; Hall 
; 
[5030:I summoned up a vision of myself pressed close to the 
kitchen door, listening to the crooks beyond it. I had stood 
there a short while, then slipped silently from the house 
through the front door. As my figure left from my vision, 
ghostly laughter echoed from the kitchen] 
; 
[5031:in the vision, I heard soft patter of cards and coarse 
voices raised in a mixture of glee and anger as the crooks 
gambled in the kitchen, then I watched myself enter the house 
from outside, heading again to the kitchen door] 
; 
[5032:watching the vision, I saw myself at first listening at 
the kitchen door, then walking over to the telephone. I focussed 
my mind on the phone and realised that I had phoned the police] 
; 
[5033:my vision reached a new intensity and showed me talking 
over the telephone to my colleagues on the force. But before I 
could give my location, the kitchen door blasted open and a 
villain entered the hall, pointing a gun at me. He snatched 
the handset from me, listened long enough to confirm who I 
had been talking to and slammed the phone down.
% %"What have you told them, spy?", he yelled, waving the gun] 
; 
[5034:I watched the vision of myself struggling with the armed 
crook, a fight that ended with the sharp crack of a gunshot and 
my assailant falling to the floor and twitching into stillness. 
%I felt a sudden sharp pang of distress, as if something evil 
had entered the spirit world] 
; 
[5035:I visualised the other ^N crooks running into the hall 
and surrounding me. I saw that ^N Sarah, my ^N partner, was 
among them, pointing a revolver at me. If she had been feeling 
any concern for me, she was hiding it well, but there would 
have been little she could have done against those odds. They 
stood for a moment weighing up the situation, then two 
criminals picked up the one I had just killed, and dragged 
him up the stairs towards the landing] 
; 
[5036:I was reluctant to continue and the vision faded, until 
I snapped myself back to attention and concentrated once more. 
The picture firmed to show one of the crooks hitting me over 
the head with a gun butt and me slumping to the floor. Then 
he stood guard while the rest of the them spread out in 
all directions through the house, destroying evidence before 
they left. Soon after, one of them returned from the kitchen 
with his pockets stuffed with paper] 
; 
[5037:in my vision a crook stood guard over me, in case I came 
back to my senses. Another, his pockets stuffed with paper, 
walked through the hall and into the lounge] 
;

their ^N pockets filled with their ^N belongings and anything 
that might be used as ^N evidence against them] 
; 
[5039:my vision began to fade as the crooks picked my body up and 
carried it outside through the front door. 
% %There was then only the empty hall and the lingering sense of 
malice, and the vision faded to an end] 
; 
; Kitchen 
; 
[5040:I summoned up an image of the crooks sat around a ^N table, 
deep into an ill-tempered game of ^N poker|^N cards] 
; 
[5041:I watched as the vision showed my ^N partner, ^N Sarah, 
sitting at the end of the table keeping the gambling scores on 
a piece of ^N paper. The crooks were slapping ^N ten ^N pound 
^N notes and ^N IOU's onto a pile in the middle of the 
table. One of them - John? - whispered to his neighbour. I 
caught the last few words "..if he's a spy like Severian 
says"|^N cash ^N money ^N tenners] 
; 
[5042:I visualised Sarah talking to the crooks. "The sucker's 
had time to take the bait", she sniggered. I shivered as one of 
the crooks headed towards the hall with a gun, primed and 
ready for me. I realised what was really going on, but couldn't 
take it all in. Had Sarah become one of them? Or was this part of 
some deeper game she was playing, knowing my cover was blown but 
determined to see the job through to the end?] 
; 
[5043:in the vision, I saw the crooks go on with their game of 
poker, confident that their mate could take care of the trouble. 
"Don't waste him yet, Luke", shouted one of them towards the 
hall door. "I've got a nice surprise in store for him later",
he sniggered|^N Luke] 
; 
[5044:suddenly, the vision became strong and clear as a gunshot 
blasted from out of the hallway. The crooks leapt up with a 
start, knocking the table over and scattering money across the 
^N floor. They rushed into the hall, some of them snatching guns 
from their belts as they ran] 
; 
[5046:the images of two crooks dashed into the kitchen. One of them 
went north into the breakfast room and the other one began to clear 
the kitchen. He collected all the money from the floor and stuffed 
the remaining scraps of paper into his pockets before returning to 
the hall] 
; 
[5047:the vision showed one of the crooks return from the breakfast 
room and start to check over the kitchen]

made his exit to the hall]

up a few belongings from around the ^N breakfast ^N table]

down in front of the fire and began to empty some scraps of paper 
from his pockets] 
; 
[5068:I watched the vision as it showed a crook piling up scraps 
of paper and setting fire to them with a match, before going back 
into the hall. 
%I watched the scraps of paper burning and saw that one of them, 
only slightly charred, was slowly carried up into the chimney with 
the smoke]

[5074:I imagined a deafening crack from the hallway, followed 
by gun smoke that clouded my vision] 
; 
[5075:the vision ran on, showing two ^N burly ^N villains hauling 
a ^N dead body up the ^N staircase towards me] 
; 
[5076:I watched the vision as it showed the two hefty crooks lifting 
a bloody corpse up into the attic] 
; 
[5077:the vision continued. In it I saw the two villains clamber 
down from the attic and brush their hands on their trousers. 
"I won't be drinking any more water in this house", laughed one 
of them coarsely] 
; 
[5078:the vision showed the two crooks walking back down the 
landing and into the hall to rejoin the rest of the gang] 
; 
[5079:looking down into the hallway, I watched the vision as it 
showed the crooks carrying my body outside into the night.

came into the attic, closely followed by two hefty crooks 
struggling to haul a dead weight up with them. They let it 
fall on the rafters as they took a breather, and I saw that 
they had brought the dead body of another member of the gang. 
It was the one they had called Luke] 
; 
[5097:the vision showed the two crooks slide the lid off the 
water tank and dump the dead body unceremoniously inside it. 
They pushed the lid back over the tank and climbed back down 
to the landing]

night. Could be that you're now able to heat and cool things.
