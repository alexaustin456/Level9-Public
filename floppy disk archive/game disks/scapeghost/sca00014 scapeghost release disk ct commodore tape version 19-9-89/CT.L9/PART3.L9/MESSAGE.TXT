; CT - Commodore Tape version of MESSAGE.TXT. 
; 
; Messages are of the form: [ number : text ] ; comment 
; They must be in numeric order, but gaps are allowed in the number 
; sequence, of course. 
; 
; | (vertical bar) terminates the printable part of a message. It 
;   is typed by shifting backslash (to the left of the keyboard). 
; / forces the following character to be printed literally. 
; % is carriage return. Note that carriage return is ignored if 
;   the printing is already at the start of a line, to make coding 
;   simpler. To force a real carriage return, print space first. 
; ^ (shift 6) marks a word for recognition by the parser. It is 
;   followed by a letter for word type: 
;   Adjective; Comment; conJunction; Noun; Preposition; Verb. 
; 
; Capitalization is done automatically on output and you are 
; recommended to use lower case for the first letter of messages 
; as this improves compression and will make no difference on 
; output, providing all punctuation is correct. 
; 
; Please ensure that all long room descriptions and first-time 
; messages are there. Comment blank msgs..  ;; [1375:] ; etc.. 
; Please comment all long room descriptions, first-time messages, 
; examine messages etc so we know what they refer to. e.g: 
; [1125:, where Luke had died] ; living room. 
; Exits must be clear from room descriptions or first-time msgs. 
;

; 
[5037:split the money evenly between the rest of his gang of 
importers, keeping a large cut for himself. Severian crammed 
the drugs into his briefcase and put it beneath his ^N chair] 
; 
[5038:nodded briefly to Weasel and said, "Well, I think this calls 
for a bit of entertainment. Don't you?". Weasel returned a devious 
smile and got up from his chair. 
%With some help from Big John, he grabbed Sarah in a headlock and 
took back her share of the loot while she shouted and struggled. 
"Didn't think we'd really cut in a spy did you?" sneered Weasel. 
"The police think you're a hostage, and now you are one"]

[5039:"So sorry to see you go, Sarah", said Weasel as he tossed

insurance police and will be quite safe for a few hours"..]

[5040:sniggered as he heard Sarah being dragged through the hallway. 
"Okay, the cabaret's over", he said, turning to Big John. "Now it's 
time for you to play night watchman"] 
; 
; GROUP Message to pass the time... 
[5045:John smoked a cigarette contentedly] 
[5046:Severian and the Professor talked between themselves about 
how they were going to distribute the drugs] 
[5047:Severian made some rude comments to John about the cackhanded
way his gang had operated. "Bunch of bleedin' amateurs", he sneered] 
[5048:John apologised to the Professor about the way things had 
almost gone wrong with the operation. He would keep everything 
under better control next time] 
[5049:the Professor discussed the next drugs deal with John] 
; 
[5050:took a deck of cards out of his pocket and began shuffling 
them. "We're not going anywhere until the morning rush-hour hides 
us from the police, are we? So how about a few hands to pass the 
time?", he said with a smile] 
; 
[5051:Jude cleared the table while John cut the deck of cards. "Are we 
all in?", he asked the crooks. Each of them returned a nod and John 
continued, "Good. Table stakes, no limit. OK?"]
; 
[5052:The crooks fished into their pockets and each slapped a pile 
of notes onto the table in front of them. Severian fingered his 
nervously; watching while John dealt the first hand; watching the 
cards intently as he dealt] 
; 
[5053:The players studied their hands thoughtfully, passing 
around a bottle of whisky. "Can't keep a clear head drinking 
that stuff", said the Professor as he passed on the bottle 
untouched. "You'll all see when I clean you out." 
%John smiled slyly but said nothing]
;
[5054:The first game began in earnest as they all pushed an 
initial twenty into the middle of the table. Jude took two new 
cards, but was unimpressed by them and dropped out]
;
[5055:Severian grunted, "Two", took the new cards and slotted 
them purposefully into his hand. "I'll raise you twenty", he 
said, trying to hold back a grin.%The Professor and John both 
took new cards and stayed in the game]
;
[5056:Severian took a single on the next round and pushed the 
stakes up higher. The other two folded and gave him the game; 
the Professor after a long while apparently calculating the odds, 
John after a long thoughtful stare at the back of Severian's
cards]
;
[5057:the second game lasted for some time, all four pushing the 
stakes higher all the time. There was an argument at one point 
when John dealt himself a card out of turn, but tempers were soon 
soothed with whisky] 
;
[5058:Jude was running a straight bluff with her singleton King. 
Severian was hopeful with his pair of Queens. The Professor had 
calculated the odds and reckoned that his flush was 90/% certain 
to win. John knew nobody was going to beat his four Twos]
;
[5059:Jude lit a cigarette and drew deeply on it before tossing 
her hand on the table and saying, "Maybe next time." The Professor 
followed the betting for another round before deciding that 
perhaps a 90/% chance wasn't good enough]
;
[5060:"Let's see you", snapped Severian, pushing another hundred 
into the pile. John smiled and lay down his hand. His opponent 
scowled as he threw his cards down. "Do you know the odds against 
four of anything are nearly a quarter of a million to one?" asked 
the Professor]
;
[5061:Severian had a good hand on the third game, and set out to 
play it cool, aiming to sucker John in and win back his money. But 
John seemed to know it and folded early, losing hardly anything]
;
[5062:John played the next hand cautiously until Jude - whose 
straight was a winner, had she known it - dropped out. Then he 
pushed the stakes up steadily to scoop a big pot at the showdown]
;
[5063:the deal was with the Professor. Cards flashed from his 
nimble fingers, winging low across the table to land in four 
compact piles. John struggled to follow the deal, his eyes 
flickering rapidly in a vain attempt to see each card properly]
;
[5064:the Professor scooped his cards up and held them close, 
concealed behind his outspread fingers. John surveyed his hand 
then let his gaze pass across the backs of the other player's 
cards. A flicker of anger escaped him as his eyes fell on the 
Professor's hand]
;
[5065:the Professor lay down his cards and picked up the deck. 
He glanced around the table, "Who's in?" he asked, then noticing 
John's interest in his hand, said, "I sometimes think you can see 
through the backs of cards"]
;
[5066:laughed it off. "That would be a handy trick! Give me two", 
he added with sudden decision]
;
[5067:"Let's make things interesting", suggested John. "Opening 
at five hundred. Anybody playing?" He tossed a thick wad of notes 
onto the table. Severian and the Professor matched his bid 
reluctantly. But Jude just shook her head and made it clear 
that she was dropping out of the game]
;
[5068:the other two would have been wise to follow Jude's example, 
but they had good hands and were feeling lucky. In the end, John 
just about cleaned them out. 
%"Poker's supposed to be a game of chance", the Professor glared 
at John, "but it isn't the way you play it"]
;
[5069:collected his winnings from the table and smiled broadly as 
he lit up a cigarette. 
%"Pity you don't handle the business as well as you play cards", 
said Severian, angry at his losses]
;
[5070:"Ah, easy come, easy go", said Jude soothingly, handing 
the whisky to Severian. He refused it angrily. "Maybe you'll 
have better luck next time", she went on, "Tonight is John's 
lucky night. Isn't that right, honey?" John slipped his arm 
around her waist and smiled again]

anywhere except at John and Jude. Suddenly, his eyes stopped 
and focussed on where I was standing. "What the hell's that", 
he yelled]
;
; WARNING 2
[5072:Severian pointed towards me and the others turned in my 
direction too. From their confused expressions, it was clear 
that they couldn't see me, but their combined stares began to 
make me feel very weak]

[5073:All four of the crooks squinted towards me, as if they 
could almost see me, and I suddenly felt very drowsy. 
%I couldn't stand them all staring at me any longer, and I 
felt myself dissolving into the air and being drawn back to 
my exorcised grave. 
% %Within seconds I was banished to darkness, leaving the spirit 
world forever, and failing to clear the blemished name that I 
had left behind..]

"Sheesh!", he wheezed as he took the flask from his mouth, "Fiery stuff, 
that"]

something. "Yeah!", he shouted, "The Bash Street kids! I wonder what

bed, reading his Beano and swigging large mouthfuls of whisky. "Ha! Ha! 
Ha!", he laughed as he rolled off the end of the bed and fell onto the 
floor] ; (JOHN B)
;
[5097:picked his soggy comic up and attempted wring the whisky back into 
his flask before climbing onto the bed again. Once he had got comfortable,

down his t-shirt]

grumbled, "I wish I had brought my Dandy along as well"]

his head in shame. "There's some garlic in the fridge, John", 
said Jude. "Maybe that will keep the vampires at bay..."

everyone's laughter]
