; 
; S1 - Spectrum 128Ktape version of MESSAGE.TXT. 
; 
; Messages are of the form: [ number : text ] ; comment 
; They must be in numeric order, but gaps are allowed in the number 
; sequence, of course. 
; 
; | (vertical bar) terminates the printable part of a message. It 
;   is typed by shifting backslash (to the left of the keyboard). 
; / forces the following character to be printed literally. 
; % is carriage return. Note that carriage return is ignored if 
;   the printing is already at the start of a line, to make coding 
;   simpler. To force a real carriage return, print space first. 
; ^ (shift 6) marks a word for recognition by the parser. It is 
;   followed by a letter for word type: 
;   Adjective; Comment; conJunction; Noun; Preposition; Verb. 
; 
; Capitalization is done automatically on output and you are 
; recommended to use lower case for the first letter of messages 
; as this improves compression and will make no difference on 
; output, providing all punctuation is correct. 
;
; Please ensure that all long room descriptions and first-time 
; messages are there. Comment blank msgs..  ;; [1375:] ; etc..
; Please comment all long room descriptions, first-time messages, 
; examine messages etc so we know what they refer to. eg: 
; [1143:, in the Dunes. Etc..] ; back of Dunrollin. 
; Exits must be clear from room descriptions or first-time msgs.
