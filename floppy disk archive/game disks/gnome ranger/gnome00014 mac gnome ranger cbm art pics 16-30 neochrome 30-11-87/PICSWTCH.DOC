To load a picture, select the file from the GEM ITEM SELECTOR by
double-clicking on its filename.  To change the directory path, type in the new
pathname on the top line of the ITEM SELECTOR and click inside the directory
window.  To get the directory of a different disk, change disks and click on
the directory bar just above the directory window.

PicSwitch is fully error-trapped (I think!) using alert boxes.  You are given
the option on common errors to [Retry] the error or [Cancel].  Selecting
[Cancel] will send you back to the file selector.

The program determines the picture's format solely from the filename extender.
Be sure to use the correct extender as listed above.  IFF pics are the only
ones that are checked for proper format.  DEGAS pics (.PI1 - .PI3) are checked
to be sure the actual picture resolution matches the extender.  If it does not,
you are given the option of viewing it anyway, or aborting.

With any picture displayed on the screen, you can view the command list by
pressing HELP, exit to the file selector by pressing UNDO (or the right mouse
button), or [S]ave the picture in a new format.

The following commands are also available for IFF pics...
   *  [1]-[5] or [SPACE]:
         'Pulls out' the selected bit-plane from the screen image.  (Amiga
         lo-rez 320x200 32-color IFF pics are the only format supported in
         this version of PicSwitch.  Since the ST can only display 16
         colors (4-bit planes) at a time, one plane must be taken out of
         the screen image.)  Most pics look best with the default setting
         (planes 2-5 displayed).
   *  [R],[G],[B]:
         Red, Green, Blue touch-up.  Boosts the selected color up a notch.
   *  [Return]:
         Restores the default settings.

For MacPaint documents, the screen can be scrolled over the picture using the
mouse.  Pressing [S] will allow you to save the displayed portion of the
document in DEGAS med-rez format.  (MacPaint documents are 576x720 pixels.)

[NOTE: If the file was downloaded with a modem on a non-Mac computer, there may
be an extra 128-byte "MacBinary" header at the beginning of the file.  If this
is the case, PicSwitch automatically adjusts for the longer header.]

PicSwitch also allows you to view DEGAS (and NeoChrome) hi-rez monochrome
pictures normally only viewable on the Atari SM124 monochrome monitor, and you
can permanently convert these to med-rez if you wish.

Finally (for now anyway) you can view and convert screens saved with the Atari
"Snapshot" program (found in the AtariDevelopers' sig) from medium or hi-rez
NeoChrome to med-rez DEGAS so that you can touch them up with Tom Hudson's
DEGAS package.

If you don't have access to Mac or Amiga pics, plenty of great artwork can be
found on the sigs here on CIS and also in the DELPHI "MicroManiac" computer art
sig.  If you find any good pics you'd like to share, upload them here!  If
possible, please retain the original artists name on the converted picture.

This version of PicSwitch is in the public domain.  Distribute it freely.

Any comments, suggestions for enhancement, or problems should be sent to me
here or via EasyPlex.  Enjoy!
