%In the parallel realm of Baskalos, the arcane arts mirror our 
technology. At the time when the the Red Moon crystal was the sole 
active source of magik, its theft was a potential disaster for the 
history of both worlds. You must recover it...%] 
[231:you hear nothing special. ] 
[232:a fleet of small slimy things pop briefly into existence and 
lollop across the floor, squeaking a chorus from Der Rosenkavalier. ] 
[233:time goes by. Ho hum] 
[234:no one here wants ] 
[235:yeuch! No thanks! ] 
[236:it opens. ] 
[237:it closes. ] 
[238:I didn't expect that. ] 
[239:you're dead and stand on the dismal plain of Limbo... ] 
[240:then a cheerless voice intones: ] 
[241:"I suppose you want to live again. They all do. Can't see 
why. Miserable thing, life... Well?" ] 
[242:"Will you dare the mortal world once more?" ] 
[243:"Do you want to live once more?" ] 
[244:flares of light surround you, then slowly fade... ] 
[245:but nothing has changed. ] 
[246:be more careful in future! ] 
[247:something attacks from the dark. ]

; 
[259:it is firmly, and magically, sealed. ] 
[260:Wirts mirt mud? ] 
[261:] 
[262:what with? ] 
[263:a heavy metal gate clangs ominously shut behind you. ] 
[264:the gate firmly bars the entrance. ] 
[265:But, fortunately, it is open. ]
[266:"Oh *@!!*! - not another puling adventurer!" he thunders, 
"I had hoped for some entertainment, a fine tune, perhaps a madrigal 
or two." ] ; it's BOSTOG the dwarf speaking 
[267:the gate will never close again. ] 
[268:the gate creaks open and the key falls away, 
disintegrating in a shower of rusty flakes. ] 
[269:the handle fits into the hole with a faint click. ] 
[270:the handle cranks round and round, slowly opening the great 
sluices that confine the murky waters of the reservoir. ] 
[271:the glowing sphere wobbles a little in the air, then floats away! ]

[274:no thanks! That water's like brown sludgeyour lungs are on fire! You can't breathe underwater! ]

[293:but is rendered useless. ] 
[294:gallantly, you attack] 
[295:you strike at] 
[296:wildly, you charge at] 
[297:who neatly sidesteps, dodging your blow. ] 
[298:you have slain] 
[299:with a disease spell. ] 
[300:by throwing some mummy's dust. ] 
[301:with a fireball] 
[302:with a lightning bolt]

[307: hit points left. ] 
[308:you can't go that way - the exit is blocked by your opponent. ] 
[309:you turn tail and flee - but not quite fast enough! ] 
[310:the sarcophagus creaks open, to reveal a well-preserved mummy, 
with a brooch lying upon its breast. ] 
[311:the mummy collapses into itself and crumbles away. Soon, 
only a pile of dust is left. ] 
[312:your incantation lacks power and sounds as feeble as 
moonshine at noon. ] 
[313:nothing happens. You lack the proper focus for that spell. ] 
[314:the presence of iron stops your magic! ] 
[315:the room is plunged briefly into darkness! ] 
[316:you fail. ] 
[317:the burning sword sears your hand! With a yell of pain, you 
drop it. ] 
[318:what about the fire, huh? It's kinda hot!] 
[319:Huh? I see no liquid. ] 
[320:you've already done that. ] 
[321:the water slops out. ] 
[322:brim-full of water. ] 
[323:"If you let me live, I will let you have these spices", Ziix 
whines. ] 
[324:you hear ] 
[325:a quiet whirring. ] 
[326:a soft click. ] 
[327:the whisper of a closing catch. ] 
[328:the magnet attracts the coins, and with a clank they leap 
through the air to cleave to its surface. ] 
[329:as the safe turns round, you can see that its back is missing! 
You find a box inside. ] 
[330:your mind's eye glides into the room and hovers there, a few 
feet above the ground. ] 
[331:you nibble the mushroom. Instantly, everything around you 
shoots up and away, apparently expanding to an incredible size! 
% 
%It takes some time to realize that the world is unchanged, but you 
have shrunk. ] 
[332:you feel the now-familiar rushing sensation in the pit of 
your stomach as you shoot back to normal size. ] 
[333:the box contains a large emerald, but opening it triggers a jet 
of poison, which squirts at face! ] 
[334:your mask saves you, the poison splashing harmlessly off its 
surface. ]
[335:Xiiz demands that you give him a treasure before he will let 
you pass. ]
[336:Xiiz dashes your worthless offering to one side, growling with 
anger. ] 
[337:grudgingly, Xiiz accepts your payment. ] 
[338:the object is] 
[339:valuable. ] 
[340:worthless. ] 
[341:normal. ] 
[342:magic. ] 
[343:your spell hits] 
[344:you bounce back up, unharmed. ] 
[345:your spell works. ] 
[346:the air around you begins to glow with a radiant pink 
light - you are surrounded by a magic aura. ] 
[347:you feel stronger. ] 
[348:that spell will only affect a sentient target. ] 
[349:for a short time, your steps feel buoyant and somehow more 
springy, but it is not long before you return to normal. ] 
[350:the presence of another living being disrupts the spell! ] 
[351:your magic shield gives a sad little moan and pops out of 
existence! ] 
[352:your strength spell comes to an end. ] 
[353: point of damage. ] 
[354:no damage. ] 
[355:your lamp is still alight! ] 
[356:you lose your grip and tumble helplessly down the well. ] 
[357:the door is too small for you to pass through! ] 
[358:you are falling... ] 
[359:"Oh it's you. Push off before I lose my temper!" ] 
[360:"Go away. I'm busy." ] 
[361:"Cretinous adventurer! What are you, lost or something?" ] 
[362:Xiiz says ] 
[363:as you enter, a perfect copy of yourself flicks into existence 
and advances to the attack! ] 
[364:you are surrounded by thousands of brilliant flashing 
lights, which dazzle your eyes and effectively blind you. ] 
[365:you can't see to move because of the lights. ] 
[366:the coins have been pushed under the grate, well out of 
your reach. ] 
[367:the pool of acid is blocking that exit. ] 
[368:the pool fizzles frantically, then becomes still. The chal you tells you that 
he has heard a rumour that mummies can be slain by magic. 
Then, thanking you again, he takes his leave and shambles away. ] 
[376:Kellf is dying of thirst! ] 
[377:] 
[378:the armour has a lot of sharp edges and is painful to wear. 
Dashed cold, too. ] 
[379:Nezzon's eyes gleam, "Goods for barter! Goods for trade!" 
she exclaims. ] 
[380:"Hmmph! You'll need to give me more than that, in exchange for 
all my stock", Nezzon says, nettled. ] 
[381:"A fair trade!" Nezzon says, g you tells you that 
he has heard a rumour that mummies can be slain by magic. 
Then, thanking you again, he takes his leave and shambles away. ] 
[376:Kellf is dying of thirst! ] 
[377:] 
[378:the armour has a lot of sharp edges and is painful to wear. 
Dashed cold, too. ] 
[379:Nezzon's eyes gleam, "Goods for barter! Goods for trade!" 
she exclaims. ] 
[380:"Hmmph! You'll need to give me more than that, in exchange for 
all my stock", Nezzon says, nettled. ] 
[381:"A fair trade!" Nezzon says, grinning. She winks jovially and 
saunters off, indicating that you should leave. ] 
[382:you find a carved acorn among the leaves. ] 
[383:as you read the scroll the acorn expands, forming a bridge over 
the chasm. ] 
; 
[385:Nezzon says ominously, "I'm not just giving them away". ] 
[386:Nezzon laughs unpleasantly, "Come on, let's have something in 
exchange. I'm not in business for my health, you know!" ] 
[387:Nezzon wants some kind of payment, and she's fingering the 
knife at her belt!.. ] 
[388:you feel stronger, but find you can't take them off again! ] 
[389:you are wearing a pair of permanent bracers. ] 
[390:the vampire cowers back, unable to attack because 
of the crucifix. ] 
[391:the vampire melts and shrivels away; dying by the light of the 
raisin sun. ] 
[392:as you enter, a demonic voice hisses, "Be warned, human, 
for I shall slay anyone who crosses this line!" ] 
[393:you cross the line and know no more... ] 
[394:you erase the line in a choking of red chalk dust. ] 
; 
[396:you fling the dust into the air, where it briefly forms a 
poisonous cloud. ] 
[397:this must be a magical fan, for a few gentle waves call forth 
a howling gale! ] 
[398:and blows the dragons' fire back at them, enveloping them 
in a sea of flames. Their bulky figures stagger backwards. ] 
[399:"Ah, it is good to meet a mortal with some culture! Allow me to 
contribute my poor mite to your quest - even though it is bound to be 
hopeless - and tell you that there is a spell hidden in these caves 
which can turn an acorn into a bridge". Bostog's mouth writhes 
briefly and you realize that he is trying to smile, an exercise 
to which he is almost entirely unaccustomed. He shuffles away, 
humming a whimsical little dirge. ]

rushing air. ^N Weaponry and ^N armour in various stages of completion 
litters the ^N three ^N great ^N tables and hangs from the ^N walls] 
;

;

^N entrance to the west]

One ^N bottle full of ^N leeches has fallen over and its contents 
escaped. Watch where you tread - they're squelchy!]

[771:. It is the ^N shambolic ^N abode of ^N Drellap the ^N Troll; 
a ^N chaotic and ^N squalid room, with ^N mouldering ^N underclothes 
strewn everywhere] 
; 
[772:, almost a hundred metres across, the ^N high ^N roof could only 
be supported by magik. A ^N thin ^N layer of ^N pink and ^N blue 
^N mist covers the floor, swirling into ^N eddies as you walk] 
; 
[773: where Saxa undertakes his arcane research. In contrast to the 
splendour of the circular room nearby, this study is small and 
neat - its ^N walls covered by ^N grey ^N books with titles like: 
"The Pin's Head - Half a Million Angels and Still Counting"] 
; 
[774: absolutely choked with the ^N accumulation of ^N years. 
^N Bulging ^N filing-cabinets lean crazily against the walls, 
^N papers spilling from their ^N half-open ^N drawers. ^N Rough 
^N notes and ^N jottings are strewn over the ^N desk and ^N chairs, 
and the floor is covered with ^N piles of old ^N manuscripts bound 
together with ^N tattered ^N red ^N ribbons] 
; 
[776:, lord of light and darkness. An ^N inscription set in the west 
wall reads "And Muurdox shall be with you always, for he sends 
messages from the sky"] 
; 
[778:, abode of the evil wizard, Aiken Bonze. Freezing air blasts 
down from above, sending tremors through the ^N columns of ^N ice that 
link ceiling and floor. Each one vibrates with a different note, 
and their foul voices rise together in excruciating harmony] 
; 
[781: within a ^N crystal ^N cavern. Heat reflects from every 
^N gleaming ^N wall. ^N Four ^N fragile ^N walkways arc through the 
shimmering air to meet at a ^N tiny ^N platform, supported high in 
the dead centre of the ^N cave. ^N Gouts of ^N glowing ^N magma jet 
upwards, splashing onto the ^N rocks all around before falling back 
into the ^N liquid ^N fire below. The ^N noise and ^N vibration are 
terrifying, but the ^N central platform where you stand is clearly 
protected by powerful magik] 
; 
[782: which all look exactly the same] 
; 
[783:. ^N Multicoloured ^N squares cover the floor, flickering 
hypnotically round your feet as distorted sound booms out] 
; 
[784:. It must be the ^N central ^N vault of ^N Cakabol] 
; 
[785: with no way out] 
; 
[786:. A ^N narrow ^N aisle leads down the centre of the room, between 
rows of ^N shallow ^N stone ^N troughs] 
; 
[790: where ^N nonmort ^N worshippers gather for their evil rites. 
Open ^N coffins are stacked against the walls] 
; 
[796: of classic proportions, decorated in the best of good taste] 
; 
[801: in the form of a ^N ruined ^N Lunar ^N temple] 
;
; 
[802: which lights up the water in this cave, clearly showing a 
^N hole in the ^N north ^N wall. ^N Eyeless ^N fish cluster round, as 
if they can feed on the ^N radiance] 
; 
[803: with the ^N surface ^N shimmering above you] 
; 
[804:, its ^N cold, ^N dark ^N waters gurgling dully around your body] 
; 
[805:, and the ^N water holds you with ^N fingers of ^N ice] 
; 
[806:, its ^N muddy ^N floor oozing around your ankles. A dim light 
shines down through the water from above] 
; 
[808:, where strange lights glimmer in its ^N murky ^N depths] 
; 
[809: where an ^N icy ^N current flows strongly from some unseen 
entrance, mingling with the ^N rushing ^N waters] 
; 
[810:, its walls carved into ^N strange and ^N fantastic ^N shapes by 
the ^N eddies of a hundred centuries] 
; 
[811: where the ^N waters play; echoing down long ^N tunnels to 
fathomless cavern-depths] 
; 
[812: and the dark waters pound above your head] 
; 
[813: where cerulean light slants, shimmering, through the ^N silent 
^N waters; reflecting from the ^N serene, ^N blue-crystal ^N walls] 
; 
[814: where the ^N still, ^N dark ^N waters lie tranquil] 
; 
[824: of stagnant water. All ^N kinds of ^N debris floats on its 
^N surface, rank and unwholesome] 
; 
[825:: acrid water percolates down from the ^N roof, leaving ^N trails 
of ^N evil-coloured ^N residuum] 
; 
[826:. A ^N monument to ^N Gothic ^N kitsch, it has ^N stone 
^N balustrades ^N carved into ^N rampant ^N curlicues and ^N scrolls, 
^N gargoyles wherever gargoyles could conceivably be fitted in, 
and ^N lattice-work wherever they couldn't] 
; 
[827:, edging around a ^N narrow ^N ledge which skirts the ^N depths 
below. A ^N mighty ^N jet of water shoots up from the ^N abyss, in a 
^N roaring ^N column that drenches the ledge with ^N icy ^N spray] 
; 
[828: where ^N oil weeps from the rocks and ^N dribbles in ^N pinguid 
^N rivulets] 
; 
[829:. Abandoned years ago, the ^N grain ^N store is full of 
^N shrivelled ^N seed and ^N gnawed ^N sacking] 
; 
[830: where ^N grimy ^N sleeping ^N furs lie scattered haphazardly 
on the ^N floor] 
; 
[832: lit by a ^N solitary ^N torch] 
; 
[833: where some cataclysmic force has cloven the ^N blue-grey 
^N slate of ^N roof and ^N walls and upraised the ^N floor into 
^N jagged ^N plates and ^N pyramids] 
; 
[834: south of an ^N impressive door on which is engraved in spidery 
letters the ^N legend, "^N Cave ^N Canum"] 
; 
[837: whose ^N floor crackles with a ^N blue ^N fire of 
^N electricity, leaving a hot, tickly smell in the air] 
; 
[838: where the breeze soughs among the ^N high ^N stone ^N beams, 
fluttering the ^N tarpaulin-covered ^N boxes and scattering ^N clouds 
of dust and ^N chaff] 
; 
[841: whose ^N curved ^N sides glisten black, like the scales of a 
brittle insect. ^N Tissue-thin ^N fragments of ^N strange ^N rock 
scrunch satisfyingly under your feet] 
; 
[846:, its sides streaked with ^N sulphurous ^N deposits and 
^N tumescent ^N crystals. ^N Acrid ^N fumes sear your nose and lungs] 
; 
[847: where a ^N section of the ^N roof has collapsed inwards, 
leaving a ^N pile of ^N sharp boulders and ^N rocks that almost 
block your passage] 
; 
[848:. The partial collapse of the cave beyond has spilled 
^N rubble into the storage area and carried a large part of the 
^N entrance ^N arch with it. ^N Large ^N cracks transect the ceiling 
and from them issue the strange squeaks and groanings of the room smells 
of ^N potpourri, ^N lavender and hot spiced wine] 
; 
[859: where ^N gentle ^N breezes blow, calling forth phantom voices from
