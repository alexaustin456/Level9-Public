[1932:the droid says, "Sorry, you are already registered for a job.

[1941:an alarm sounds, lasers flash and gas pours from outlets on
the saucer. ]
[1942:it's poison! ]
[1943:a technician wearing a gas mask looks out of the saucer and
shouts inside, "False alarm". ]
[1944:a technician looks out of the saucer and shouts inside, "Another
false alarm. Turn it off and ask maintenance to check it in the

[1945:two human technicians are playing cards as you enter. They are

[1994:you are soon comfortably settled in the cocoon. The waldroid
is in the workshop, and you soon forget about your immediate
surroundings and can move the waldroid about as if it was you.
After stacking boxes for hours, you get a little time to yourself. ]

without hard evidence your threats are worthless. Army droids
close in...] 
[2035:You threaten to tell the truth about the fake aliens and
wave the costume as proof. Eventually a deal is struck. You give
back the alien costume and, in return, are adopted into the party
leadership. This means wealth, power and status. Congratulations!
You have won! ]

[2104:colour codes correspond to where you are in the ET system. Each
colour corresponds to a number: black=0, brown=1, red=2, orange=3,
yellow=4, green=5, blue=6, violet=7, grey=8, white=9. The colour
code thus gives a six-digit number. The first digit shows in which
pyramid the destination is located.%
Each time you
go in towards the centre of the dartboard (north), your movements east
and west affect your position (colour code) by three times as
much. The best way to navigate is to go northeast until
the current colour code passes the one you want. Then go south, and
west until you pass the desired
code again. Then go south again, and move east towards the desired
code until you go too far. Repeat this and you will zig-zag out
to the outer ring, where you should be at your destination. ]
[2105:everything in your home is voice-activated, through a central
computer. This saves on individual conrols, as well as providing
an integrated buggin system. ]

of science fiction. ]
