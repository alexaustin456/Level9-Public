; ST version of MESSAGE.TXT: messages/keywords for the game. 
; 
; Messages are of the form: [ number : text ] ; comment 
; They must be in numeric order, but gaps are allowed in the number 
; sequence, of course. 
; 
; | (vertical bar) terminates the printable part of a message. It 
;   is typed by shifting backslash (to the left of the keyboard). 
; / forces the following character to be printed literally. 
; % is carriage return. Note that carriage return is ignored if 
;   the printing is already at the start of a line, to make coding 
;   simpler. To force a real carriage return, print space first. 
; ^ (shift 6) marks a word for recognition by the parser. It is 
;   followed by a letter for word type: 
;   Adjective; Comment; conJunction; Noun; Preposition; Verb. 
; 
; Capitalization is done automatically on output and you are 
; recommended to use lower case for the first letter of messages 
; as this improves compression and will make no difference on 
; output, providing all punctuation is correct. 
; 
; Please ensure that all long room descriptions and first-time 
; messages are there. Comment blank msgs.. ;; [1375:] ; etc.. 
; Please comment all long room descriptions, first-time messages, 
; examine messages etc so we know what they refer to. e.g: 
; [1143:, in the Dunes. Etc..] ; back of Dunrollin. 
; Exits must be clear from room descriptions or first-time msgs. 
; 
; punctuation messages..

ever happened]

some of Mother's flat loaves for use as grindstones, and a large

gno wind to drive the sails.

[5000:filled the sink with cold water and put the dishes in to 
soak] 
[5001:watched the dishes soaking in the sink for a while, then 
took then out and piled them on the side to drain dry] 
[5002:fastened the springs back into the sofa that Flopsy had 
ruined by using it as a trampoline] 
[5003:%Flopsy spotted the mended sofa and leapt onto it, bouncing 
happily] 
; 
; kitchen #2 
[5005:cracked an egg into a frying pan and began to fry it over 
the stove. It sizzled gnoisily in the fat] 
[5006:put the egg on a plate and sat down to eat it, using the 
yolk to soften a slice of bread] 
[5007:%Flopsy mooched around the kitchen floor, eating all the 
dropped crumbs and splodges of egg] 
[5008:threw the plate into the sink] 
; 
; farmyard 
[5010:trudged over to the barn with a shovel to muck out the 
guinea pigs, and then returned, having fallen headfirst into 
the swill bucket] 
[5011:%Flopsy ran to the barn to play hide and seek with the 
guinea pigs in their bedding. When she returned, Ingrid held her 
gnose and sent Flopsy down to the Dribble for a bath] 
[5012:threw a few handfuls of grain towards the bantams, while 
keeping at a safe distance from them] 
[5013:%Flopsy ran playfully around the farmyard, chasing the 
bantams. Suddenly, she yelped and returned with a swollen gnose. 
"My, my", mused Ingrid, "You do look a bit hen-pecked today, 
Flopsy"] 
[5014:wandered over to the hayloft to look for a gneedle, and then 
returned looking rather bored] 
; 
; field 
[5015:scattered a few seeds around the field, then sat down 
saying, "Phew! Hard work all this farming"] 
[5016:%Flopsy dug the seeds up again and collected them into a 
gnice gneat pile, then waited for a pat] 
[5017:dug up a large turnip, brushed the soil off it, and began 
to chew it thoughtfully] 
[5018:wandered all over the field, trampling the crop and 
complaining that it was going to be a poor harvest again] 
; 
; warren 
[5020:looked down a few holes in the warren and tried to work out 
how many rabbits there were by counting the droppings around 
them] 
[5021:%Flopsy thought it would be a good idea to chase the 
rabbits. So she tried it, but they boxed her ears and refused to 
play] 
[5022:helped Bumpy to dig up a few carrots. They found a handful 
for themselves and had just sat down for a gnibble, when some 
rabbits came up and walked off with most of them] 
[5023:chatted to Bumpy and shared the last gnarled carrot with 
him] 
[5024:%Flopsy began to dig furiously, throwing dust and soil into 
the air. The dust slowly settled to reveal a giant carrot. While 
Bumpy was trying to decide what to do with it, some rabbits 
popped out and carried it off back into the warren] 
;--- 
; BUMPY 
[5025:greeted Ingrid with a friendly twitch of his gnose. "Hello, 
Ingrid", he said, "Come and have a look at the gnew gnurseries. 
Rabbits have built two of them, all soft and fur-lined"] 
[5026:tried to remember which of the entrances lead to the 
gnurseries. He had three false starts - Ingrid got him out again 
each time - then had the bright idea of following a doe. He 
reappeared moments later with a black eye. "She were just going 
to the ladies loo", he explained] 
[5027:explained for the umpteenth time how important his job as 
rabbit-herd was] 
[5028:%Bumpy remembered where the gnurseries were, wandered 
into a gnarrow tunnel and got stuck. Ingrid watched as Flopsy 
bounded across and dragged him out by the foot] 
;--- 
; JUMBO 
[5030:greeted Ingrid with a big smile and asked, "How about a 
gnice drop of my special brew?" 
%Before she had time to refuse, Jumbo had already filled a mug 
with the seething liquid. "Have it on the house", he said 
with a grin] 
[5031:%Flopsy wandered around the inn, licking up puddles of 
spilled beer. When she had finished, she walked smack into a 
table leg and collapsed] 
[5032:mopped his sweating brow. "It's thirsty work is this!", he 
sighed and pulled himself a pint of Gnewcastle Brown. He raised 
the tankard and drained it in one large gulp] 
[5033:asked Flora if the pies were ready yet. She gnodded and 
brought in a plate of tempting fish pies, still hot from the 
oven] 
[5034:licked his lips and said, "Mmmm! Those pies look mighty 
good!" He took the plate of pies and grinned broadly] 
[5035:went along the bar and began to stuff himself furtively 
with fish pies]

[5037:Ingrid took a small sip of the scrumpy and suddenly felt 
violently ill. The room began to revolve around her and soon all 
she could see was a whirling frenzy of chairs and tables until 
finally the ceiling came into view. Then everything went black. 
% 
%Ingrid woke to bright flashing lights and firework displays, and 
the peculiar sensation of something hot and wet sliding across 
her forehead. She opened her eyes and found that she was sprawled 
in the lane outside the inn, with Flopsy standing over her, 
licking her face.% %] 
;--- 
; FLORA 
[5040:cracked half a dozen eggs into a bowl and whipped them up. She 
threw in a few more ingredients, mainly fish, and stirred the 
mixture] 
[5041:poured the mixture out of the bowl and into a bun-tray. She 
popped it into the oven and turned up the draught on the fire] 
[5042:%Flopsy put her front paws up on the worktop and began to 
lick out the bowl out. "Shoo! Shoo! You filthy great mutt!", 
yelled Flora, brandishing a large rolling pin. Flopsy cowered 
away and hid behind Ingrid] 
[5045:sorted out the groceries and made a tray of sandwiches] 
[5046:opened the oven and took out a tray of golden-baked buns. 
The kitchen was filled with delicious smells] 
[5047:held a tray of buns in the air and shouted, "Anyone for 
buns?" There was a stampede as the customers fought to be first] 
[5048:sipped a tankard of stout and chatted to Jumbo. She paused 
occasionally to belch and pat her ample stomach] 
;--- 
; MISS FARTHING 
[5050:unpacked a crate of turnips and arranged them on a 
shelf. "It's ridiculous!", she said, "Turnips have shot up since 
that there the Stock Market crash!" As Ingrid looked puzzled, Miss 
Farthing added, "It were a cartful of turnips that crashed"] 
[5051:%Flopsy pulled a box down off a shelf and tipped mushrooms 
all over the floor. Miss Farthing yelled angrily as Flopsy 
bounced about, eating them all] 
[5052:made interesting arrangements of vegetables in the shop 
window. She stood back to admire her work and smiled broadly 
to herself] 
[5053:chomped on an apple and talked to Ingrid, splattering 
the counter with bits] 
[5054:counted the change in the till and shook her head sadly. 
"If you're gnot going to buy anything, clear off!", she said, 
"There's gno-one else'll come in while you're here"] 
;--- 
; GRANDMA 
[5060:bent down and looked under her bed. "There'd best gnot be 
gno Gnorsegnomes hidigng ign my bedroom!", she said] 
[5061:lifted a section of carpet up from the stairs and squinted 
through the cracks in the floorboards. "Well, I cagn't see gno 
Gnorsegnomes dowgn there!", she sighed, "But it beigng so dark I 
cagn't see gnowt agnyway"] 
[5062:opened the oven door and looked inside for Gnorsegnomes. 
She couldn't see any of them, but closed the door tight and fed 
the fire just in case they might be camouflaged] 
[5063:went into the pantry and lifted down the stack of smoked 
hams looking for invading Gnorsegnomes. "They could be lurkigng 
agnywhere", she explained] 
[5064:%Flopsy followed her into the pantry and set to work on the 
hams] 
[5065:hobbled to the barn to root among the bantam eggs for any 
sign that the Gnorsegnomes were in town] 
[5066:%Flopsy trotted behind, licking up the eggs that Grandma 
dropped and broke] 
[5067:pushed the guinea pigs out of the way so that she could 
probe their bedding for Gnorsegnomes] 
[5068:waded into the duck pond, and prodded among the weeds, 
looking for Gnorsegnomes] 
[5069:%Flopsy jumped into the duck pond with Grandma Gnutson. 
"Here!", cried Grandma, "Begogne, you great muddy lummox! You're 
soakigng me with your splashigng"] 
[5070:dug up a few potatoes while searching the earth for 
Gnorsegnomes] 
[5071:looked down all the rabbit holes for Gnorsegnomes. She 
couldn't see any, so she started to poke among the rabbit 
droppings on the path in search of footprints] 
[5072:asked Bumpy if he had seen any Gnorsegnomes. He shook his 
head, but Grandma insisted on making him stand up in case he was 
sitting on one and hadn't gnoticed] 
;--- 
; GREAT AUNT HALFYARD 
[5080:boiled the kettle on the stove, to make tea and then handed 
a cup to Ingrid, who thirstily gulped it down before realising 
how hot it was] 
[5081:%Flopsy wagged her tail excitedly as Great Aunt Halfyard 
handed her a large bone] 
[5082:sat down and sipped her tea slowly while reading the local 
gnewspaper. "Well I gnever", she sighed, "Just look at this 
picture of that Jasper Whassisname person!" She was holding up 
the front page of the paper in front of Ingrid's gnose. It showed 
a photograph of Jasper Quickbuck on a yacht with members of the 
local council. 
% 
%"He's got a gnerve trying to get the council to back his plans by 
giving them free holidays", she said, "But I'm sure they won't 
give in to this bribery..."] 
[5083:read another article in her paper, "And look at this photo 
of the escaped gorilla".
%Ingrid wondered how Rollo had managed to get his gorilla story 
planted in a gnational gnewspaper] 
[5084:%Flopsy shook herself and spread dust everywhere] 
[5085:looked up at the blue sky and sighed. "What a lovely day", 
she said as she pruned the ivy around the window with a large 
pair of clippers] 
[5086:%Just then, Flopsy decided to water the ivy by Aunt 
Halfyard's feet. Aunt Halfyard threatened to prune Flopsy's 
tail with the clippers if she tried that again] 
[5087:hummed a merrily while she trampled a patch of the long 
grass on her lawn to make space for her deckchair] 
[5088:sat down in her deckchair in the rain and daydreamed for 
a while. "I hope things stay this way in Little Moaning for years 
to come", she sighed] 
;--- 
; BONEY SPRATT 
[5090:took a wriggling worm out of a tin and pushed it onto the end of 
his fishing hook. He cast his line into the river and rested his rod 
on the bank] 
[5091:%Flopsy sniffed Boney's worms and decided to eat one of them. 
"Oi!", stormed Boney. "That was my best worm you just ate, you daft 
mutt"] 
[5092:opened his lunchbox and took out a carrot and treacle sandwich. 
He chomped it hungrily while keeping an eye on his fishing float] 
[5093:%Flopsy sniffed at Boney's carrot and treacle sandwich but 
decided that was one thing she definitely did gnot want to eat] 
[5094:shouted with glee as his float bobbed up and down in the 
water. He spluttered half of a sandwich out of his mouth and a 
gherkin fell into his worm tin. 
%He frantically reeled in his line to find an old boot on his 
hook] 
[5095:unhitched the boot, threw it back in and absently put a 
gherkin on his hook by mistake. He cast out his line again and 
waited] 
[5096:opened a flask, poured himself a mug of warm beer and 
sipped it gnoisily] 
[5097:waved to a elf on a passing barge. Suddenly, his line 
unreeled rapidly, tangling itself around his foot. As the barge 
sailed down the river, Boney was dragged behind it into the 
water. 
% 
%Luckily, Boney managed to wriggle free and swim back to the bank. 
He scooped his rod out of the water with his gnet and then 
shouted a few choice words to the elf on the barge] 
[5098:packed his fishing tackle up in a huff (gnomish fishing bag) 
and explained to Ingrid that, "The weather's gnot right for 
fishing today"] 
;--- 
; GNAT 
[5100:clung gnervously onto the carriage and said, "I'm gnot 
getting out, lass! You'd smash this thing up on your own!" 
%"Really, Mr Tackhammer", said Ingrid reassuringly, "You know 
you can rely on me to look after it". 
%"Well, I'm sticking with my carriage!", Gnat said intrepidly] 
[5101:yelled at Flopsy to stop chewing his carriage] 
[5102:patted his invention lovingly and said, "Do take care of my 
carriage. It took me ages to build it". 
%Ingrid said, "And I'll make sure that it lasts for ages, Mr. 
Tackhammer. Gnow don't you worry about a thing. I've got it all 
worked out"] 
[5103:shook his head in despair and groaned, "Eee, I wish you'd 
gnever laid eyes on this carriage"] 
;--- 
; MILLIE 
[5110:said, "Well, hello there Ingrid. It's gnice to have a bit 
of company. It gets so boring on my own here"] 
[5111:chatted to Ingrid and told her how, this being the dull 
season for glow-worms, she was having to improvise the lighting 
for the time being. 
%She pointed to a candle in a foil-covered washing up bowl. 
"It's terrible, isn't it?", she sighed. Ingrid gnodded 
sympathetically as the candle went out] 
[5112:lit the lighthouse candle again. 
% 
%Flopsy wagged her tail happily, and the draught blew the candle 
out again. Millie lost her temper and chased Flopsy round and 
round the room] 
[5113:jumped up at the sound of a loud crash as a ship ploughed 
into the other wrecks on Dribble Banks. Millie looked out of the 
window and then blamed Ingrid for the shipwreck. 
%"Gnow look what you've gone and done!", she yelled, "That there 
candle was burning brightly until you turned up. Why don't you 
just clear off and let me get on with my job!" Ingrid explained 
her bright ideas for improved lamps, but Millie did gnot seem to 
be listening just then] 
[5114:said, "Go on, hop it! Or I'll sling you out of the window"]

; SEAMUS 
[5120:twitched gnervously. "Sure and it's these teleport 
spells!", he complained, "They'll gnot work properly at all, at 
all. See me, I gnever know where I'll end up gnext"] 
[5121:%Flopsy put her head on one side and looked at Seamus as if 
she didn't believe a word of it] 
[5122:said, "Begorra! I think I've left my magic wand behind". He 
grinned sheepishly at Ingrid. 
%"I must have, err, left it upstairs somewhere. Anyhow, don't you 
go hanging round for me, Ingrid. You'd best be away about your 
business"] 
[5123:and Mrs Tackhammer were busy looking for the magic wand. It 
seems like it must have been somewhere in the bed because they 
were both rummaging about under the covers. 
% 
%Ingrid coughed to attract their attention, and two heads popped 
out and blinked in the light. It must have been hot under there 
since they both had very red faces. "Err, we haven't found it 
yet", explained Seamus, and added quickly, before she offered to 
help, "But don't you worry, we can manage by ourselves. Good day 
to you gnow"]

; ROOK 
[5130:cawed and said, "I think it's terrible that Jasper 
Quickbuck is trying to clear the valley. It'll be our trees 
gnext, after your village. If there's anything that I can do to 
help, then just ask"] 
[5131:%Flopsy sniffed the rook. It took offence and pecked Flopsy 
on the gnose. "You're the one who stinks, you smelly old mutt!", 
it cawed] 
[5132:ruffled its feathers and dipped its back into a sort of 
saddle shape]

[5153:shouted towards the kitchen, "Come on Flora! We're

[5160:went to the bar, asked for a pint of best, and gossiped to 
Jumbo while he pulled the drink] 
[5161:%Flopsy stood under the barrel (from which Jumbo had just 
pulled a pint) and caught every last drop of beer that dripped 
from the tap] 
[5162:slapped some change on the counter to pay for the beer, 
then sat down to drink it] 
[5163:looked at Armillaria Budblast and yelled, "There's a funny 
smell around here! Have you stood in something, Armillaria?"] 
[5164:sipped a pint of best and chatted to the other customers] 
[5165:%The customers held their gnoses and moved to the opposite 
side of the inn] 
[5166:went off to see when the gnext ferry would be, then 
returned and asked about rooms for the gnight] 
[5167:bought a packet of peanuts and tossed them one by one into 
the air, trying to be clever and catch them in the mouth. Flopsy 
hovered close by, snapping up each one as it hit the floor]

[5170:chatted to Flora and took a bun from the tray she was carrying] 
[5171:dipped the bun in a pint of beer and gnibbled it with delight]

pieces of bun that fell to the floor]

[5180:wiped the darts scoreboard clean with a cloth and chalked 
up 501 for himself and the salesgnome.

%The salesgnome had the first throw at the board and scored 
twelve. A few sniggers came from the watching crowd] 
[5181:threw his darts at the board and scored one hundred and 
eighty. Everyone in the inn cheered. The salesgnome got two 
twenties and an old calendar] 
[5182:threw again and scored another one hundred and eighty! The 
audience applauded him. The salesgnome threw his darts on the 
floor in a temper and stamped on them] 
[5183:threw his darts and scored one hundred and thirty gnine. 
Those few customers that could do sums gasped in amazement. He 
only gneeded double 1 to win. The salesgnome started to throw his 
darts at the other drinkers] 
[5184:%Flopsy went and sat on the salesgnome before someone got 
hurt] 
[5185:took his last throw and won the game with the first dart. 
He walked over to the salesgnome and helped him up from the 
ground. He offered to shake hands, but the salesgnome just 
punched him in the face, and started a brawl. Luckily, Ingrid 
managed to break it up before any real damage was done]

; SALESGNOME playing darts alone

[5190:practiced playing darts on his own] 
[5191:pushed all three darts in the bullseye of the dartboard 
when gnobody was looking. He quickly stood back and coughed 
loudly] 
[5192:shouted, "Anyone for darts?" but there was gno reply] 
[5193:aimed carefully and threw his darts at the dartboard. He 
succeeded in hitting a table, a vase and somebody's stickleback 
pie and chips] 
[5194:bad-temperedly threw his darts towards the board without 
looking. Amazingly he got a bull's eye and two triple twenties] 
;--- 
; SILAS/SURVEYOR wandering survey 
[5200:measured the front of the Green Gnome Inn with a tape 
measure and then scribbled a few figures onto a gnotepad. He 
stood back, looking at the inn and stroking his chin 
thoughtfully] 
[5201:aimed a kick at Flopsy. Flopsy looked at Ingrid to check 
if it was all right to bite him. Ingrid wasn't looking, so 
she did] 
[5202:inspected the broken bridge and shook his head. "Doesn't 
gnobody bother to repair gnothing in this village?", he asked 
rhetorically] 
[5203:prodded Boney in the back and said, "Oi! Why don't you fix 
that bridge instead of fooling around with that silly fishing 
rod?!" 
%"Mind your own business", snapped Boney, "or I'll fix you with my 
fishing rod"] 
[5204:took a pad out of his pocket and began to sketch the 
buildings along the High Street. "Hmmm", he said, "Soon have this 
little lot down"] 
[5205:looked up Ploughgnome Lane and shook his head. "This 
hill's going to be a gnuisance when we start work. It will have 
to be moved at least half a chain to the left"] 
[5206:looked around and rubbed his hands together. "Plenty of 
land to build on around here", he concluded] 
[5207:looked down across Little Moaning and compared the view 
with some development plans] 
[5208:took one look at the farm and said, "What a dump! I can't 
wait to wipe out this blot on the landscape"]

; MRS UNDERLAY 
[5210:shouted to Jumbo, "Oi! Get me a tomato juice"] 
[5211:slobbered her tomato juice down her chin, spilling most 
of it on the floor. "Oi!", she shouted to Jumbo, "Look at the 
mess in this place"] 
[5212:opened a gnewspaper and lit up a cigarette] 
[5213:read her gnewspaper loudly, so that everyone could hear 
about Little Moaning being due for demolition. She took a long 
drag of her cigarette and then coughed so much that her false 
teeth flew out] 
[5214:put her teeth back in and crushed her cigarette end on the 
floor. Having read the headlines aloud to everyone in the inn, 
she folded up the gnewspaper] 
[5215:dozed in her chair for a few minutes and muttered in her 
sleep about turnips and the Stock Market crash. She woke with a 
start] 
[5216:took some tobacco out of a pouch and began to chew it] 
[5217:spat a plug of tobacco into the ashtray]

[5220:patted her coat pockets, which bulged with compost. "I'll 
plant my daffodils in this", she quietly muttered to herself] 
[5221:searched around for dead leaves to put on her compost heap] 
[5222:ignored the gnotice and examined the plants growing around 
its post] 
[5223:%Flopsy leapt up at the gnotice while Armillaria was 
still crouched down examining the plants around it. Armillaria 
struggled slowly up from the mud she landed in] 
[5224:pulled up some weeds that were growing along the track. She 
shook her head and tutted at the state the countryside had been 
allowed to get into] 
[5225:pestered Boney by gnattering about plants on the riverbank. 
Boney tried to ignore her and told her go and talk to a plant 
instead] 
[5226:picked a collection of wild flowers from the riverbank] 
[5227:%Flopsy pinched Armillaria's flowers and ate them] 
[5228:looked at the brambles and shook hher head. "What a gnasty

all those long sharp thorns"]
