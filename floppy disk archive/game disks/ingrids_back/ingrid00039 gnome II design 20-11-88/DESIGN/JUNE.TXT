                      LEVEL 9 NEWS: JUNE 1988

* Our new BBC Micro system is ready, so BBC Time and Magik will be on 
  sale from 7/6/88 and Gnome Ranger from 14/6/88. They are on 80-track 
  discs. Standard BBC B.. too small. BBC B with sideways OR shadow RAM, 
  or standard B+.. text only. BBC B with shadow AND sideways RAM, B+ 
  with sideways RAM, or BBC Master.. full graphics. (We tested both 
  games with the following shadow RAMs: Aries B32, Computech Integra-B, 
  Solidisk Twomeg 128K and Watford 32K Shadow RAM). 

* +3, CPC and PCW versions are one a single, triple-format 3" disc, 
  for each of Gnome Ranger and Time and Magik. To play our other 
  games on the +3, buy the Amstrad CPC/PCW versions, together with 
  +3 "Time and Magik", as the latter contains conversion software and 
  full instructions to upgrade our Amstrad discs for the Spectrum +3. 

* The next Level 9/Mandarin game is "Lancelot", a faithful re-telling 
  of the Arthurian quest for the Holy Grail. Expect it soon. 

* We are also coding "Gnome Ranger II", for launch at the PC Show. 
  And finally, Level 9 t-shirts (S,M,L,XL) are just 4 pounds each.
