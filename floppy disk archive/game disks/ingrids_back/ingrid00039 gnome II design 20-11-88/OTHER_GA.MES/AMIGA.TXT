Dear Sirs, 

          I write to complain about Commodore's current TV advert 
for their Amiga 500 computer. 

This advert makes extensive use of high-quality computer animation 
to advertise their computer, leaving the viewer with the clear 
impression that they are watching a demonstration of its powers. 

However, unlike the target audience for the advert, I already own 
an Amiga, and so know about its capabilities. So I am sure that: 

1) The Amiga 500 cannot do real-time graphics with the speed and 
   resolution of those shown in the advert. 

2) An Amiga 500 was not used to produce the majority (or possibly 
   any) of the graphics shown in its advert. 


(The exception to the above is if they modified an Amiga 500 so 
greatly that it became a different machine. Something along the 
lines of gluing it to a Cray supercomputer; then using the Cray). 


          Please help those potential buyers who have never used 
an Amiga and who may be fooled. For example, ask Commodore to add 
a statement admitting: 

"The graphics in this advert were not produced on an Amiga 500". 



                      Yours faithfully, 



                                       Pete Austin
