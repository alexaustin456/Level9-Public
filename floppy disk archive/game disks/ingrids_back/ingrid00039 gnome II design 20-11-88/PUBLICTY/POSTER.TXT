            INGRID POSTER TEXT - for Maeve Kane. 

Dear Maeve, 

           For the Ingrid poster, I have in mind an A3 poster, 
basically some fairly dark colour but with the following panels. 


         +----------------------------------------+ 
         | +-----+ +--------------------+ +-----+ |
         | |     | |  Central Heading   | |     | |
         | |     | +--------------------+ |     | |
         | |     | +--------------------+ |  R  | |
         | |  L  | |                    | |  i  | |
         | |  e  | |                    | |  g  | |
         | |  f  | |                    | |  h  | |
         | |  t  | |                    | |  t  | |
         | |     | |                    | |     | |
         | |  P  | |     Box Cover      | |  P  | |
         | |  a  | |    (exact copy)    | |  a  | |
         | |  n  | |                    | |  n  | |
         | |  e  | |                    | |  e  | |
         | |  l  | |                    | |  l  | |
         | |  s  | |                    | |  s  | |
         | |     | +--------------------+ |     | |
         | |     | +--------------------+ |     | |
         | |     | |  Centre, footing   | |     | |
         | +-----+ +--------------------+ +-----+ |
         +----------------------------------------+ 

I have in mind a dull-ish red background, with white side panels 
similar to magazine columns, broken-up with occasional screen-pics. 

The Heading and Centre footing would be reversed out. 

One design decision is whether the footing should mention all the 
computer types. (If not, people might not know what they are. But, 
if it does, less shops may display the poster). 

Another is how far to correct the spelling and grammar.  

What are people's comments on the concept?

"Without a doubt, this is the most enjoyable Level 9 adventure I 
have played to date. Go out and buy a copy!"

"Ingrid Bottomlow, the gnome with a face that could make a 
thousand hearts stop with catatonic shock, is back from her antics 
in the prequel to this game, Gnome Ranger. She returns to dear old 
Gnettlefield to find her quaint home town in a state of turmoil...

Ingrid has to get everyone to sign a petition to protest against 
the evictions... Often Ingrid will have to chase a character around 
a few locations before obtaining a signature (persistant gal, our 
Ingrid), or else use another character's help to get a signature. 
This feature of the game is highly impressive, as the characters 
seem to have a mind of their own as they wander around from place 
to place , and it adds to the adventure's realism. Commands include 
FOLLOW, WAIT FOR and FIND (a character). You can also RUN TO a 
particular place. If Ingrid is down by the lighthouse, you could 
make her go to the market square and she would go to that place, 
describing her locations as she went along. 

There are two more parts of the adventure for Ingrid to complete 
(you didn't seriously think that it would be finished in an 
evening did you?) before Gnettlefield is safe... 

You can bet you'll get your money's worth when you buy this. An 
advanced parser, characters you must interact with, a smattering of 
good humour and intrigue as well... An adventure to be enjoyed and 
very enjoyable it is too. If this is the way Level 9 are developing 
than look out Infocom, your days are numbered!" 
                   - Rated 85% in Computer Gamesweek, October 19-25 



"The pictures... are leagues ahead of earlier Level 9 titles and 
are bursting with warmth. They add a great deal to [the] enjoyment 
of the game and, because of limited multi-tasking, do not hold up 
the game too much while they're loading."      
                                       - Rated 920 in Ace, November



"The latter parts get harder and offer a greater challenge to the 
experienced adventurer. But whatever progress, or lack of it, the 
player is making, he will be rewarded throughout the game with 
short commentaries on the reactions of the characters in his 
presence - often inconsequential, but nearly always amusing. In 
fact, I found Ingrid to be the most genuinely funny of Level 9's 
adventures to date."         - Rated 10 in Commodore User, November

"Here is a game with plenty of rustic atmosphere, and a lot of 
humour... Level 9's graphics, always a sore point since those 
halcyon days of text-only adventures, have now been changed from 
digitised pictures to real artists drawings, and match the mood of 
the game nicely. 

With RAM SAVE, OOPS (repeatedly on the bigger machines), and last 
command edit facility, coupled with the sliding graphics system, 
Ingrid is a technically advanced program, as well as being a 
thoroughly entertaining adventure. 

Finally, a word of praise from Level 9 for supporting such a wide 
range of computers"                       - Rated 9 in GM, November



"Throughout the game, the personalities you meet are full of 
character and what's more they carry out many different actions 
which, when observed, add a great deal to the plot. In fact, in 
Part III, there's even a character who you can spy upon through a 
hole in the wall, watching him go about his (mysterious) business. 
All this adds greatly to the enjoyment of playing...

Playing the game is a pleasure, with each module having a different 
feel to it. There's novelty in the first, challenge in the second, 
and detective work in the third. What more could you want?"

"The rustic setting of Ingrid's Back is enhanced with a complete 
change of graphic design: out are the misty digitised pictures 
of Gnome Ranger and Knight Orc, and in are some wonderful artist 
drawn. There are fairy tale country cottages, pubs full of drunken 
gnomes, and idyllic country scenes, that all really add atmosphere 
to the game... 

There are many advanced features built into the Level 9 adventure 
system, that make the mechanics of playing the game much easier. 
RAM save is available on all but 48K Spectrum, Amstrad PC and small 
BBCs. OOPS takes you back one move and is available on all disk 
versions, with multiple OOPS on Atari ST [and other larger micros]. 
Picture sliding to reveal the text hidden behind it, previous 
command editing editing, and picture off to avoid unnecesessary 
disk loads during play are all available on a number of versions... 

Ingrid's Back has the funniest humour of any Level 9 game yet! What 
is Seamus Sosmall doing in Mrs Tackhammer's wardrobe, when you 
break into her bedroom and find her lying red-faced on the bed? 
Begorrah, if he isn't having trouble with his teleport spell and 
shouldn't he be somewhere else altogether. As you leave the house, 
he suddenly remembers he's left his magic wand upstairs, and goes 
back, insisting that you do not wait for him... 

Without a doubt, this is the most enjoyable Level 9 adventure I 
have played to date. Go out and buy a copy!"
