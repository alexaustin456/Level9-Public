Dear Sir, 

         "Ingrid's Back!" is Level 9's latest three-part adventure, 
available on the following: 

      Amiga, ST, PC, Mac ........................... #19.95 
      CPC/PCW/+3 triple-format disc ................ #19.95 
      8-bit discs: Atari XL/XE, C64, Apple II ...... #14.95 
      Tapes: CPC, Atari XL/XE, C64, MSX, Spectrum .. #14.95 

I enclose ST and Commodore 64 versions, a sheaf of reviews, a play 
sequence and a cluesheet. 


         "Ingrid's Back!" is the sequel to "Gnome Ranger", which 
has hardly been seen in the USA and so, for example, the two might 
be bundled together. Like its prequel, "Ingrid's Back!" is a comedy 
adventure, with a mix of puns, slapstick and topical satire. 

With an excellent parser and adventure system, well-written text 
and artist-drawn pictures on most disc versions (not Apple II or 
Atari 8-bit), Ingrid has done well with the reviewers. 

Some idea of the style can be gained from the following: 


                  GNOME GNEWS IS GOOD GNEWS 

Latest gnews from the Level 9 camp is the Bottomlowdown on Ingrid. 
Having tamed the wilderness in "Gnome Ranger", the original Miss 
Adventure returns home to Little Moaning.. 

"Ingrid's Back!" is the sequel to Gnome Ranger and stars the gnomes 
of Little Moaning. Their happy life of fishing, sitting out in the 
rain and drinking gnome-brew, seems doomed by Jasper Quickbuck's 
plans to steam-roller the gnome-belt for yuppie housing. 

Can stunning Ingrid Bottomlow, she whose face could stop a thousand 
clocks, save the Gnome counties? Or is she a gnome of lost causes?  

Either way, with accident-prone Ingrid on the warpath, it's going 
to be fun!
