Dear Sir, 

         "Ingrid's Back!", Level 9's latest comedy adventure, is 
just gnow available for #14.95 on Atari 8-bit disc and tape, fresh 
from its good reviews on 16-bit computers. In other words.. 


                   GNOME GNEWS IS GOOD GNEWS 

Latest gnews from the Level 9 camp is the Bottomlowdown on Ingrid. 
Having tamed the wilderness in "Gnome Ranger", the original Miss 
Adventure returns home to Little Moaning.. 

Ingrid's back to find the gnomes in trouble. Their happy life of 
fishing, sitting out in the rain and drinking gnome-brew, seems 
doomed by Jasper Quickbuck's plans to steam-roller the gnome-belt 
for yuppie housing. 

Can stunning Ingrid Bottomlow, she whose face could stop a thousand 
clocks, save the Gnome counties? Or is she a gnome of lost causes?  

Either way, with accident-prone Ingrid on the warpath amidst a 
mixture of puns, satire and slapstick, it's going to be fun! 


                       TECHNICAL DETAILS 

"Ingrid's Back!" is a massive three-part adventure: the first to 
use the full power of Level 9's unique "racetracks", for the most 
lifelike gnomes ever. 

8-bit Atari versions are on disc and tape and require at least 64K. 
Both are text-only, with RAM SAVE/RESTORE and UNDO, and cost #14.95. 
The disk version loads faster, but the tape version has more text. 

          For the record, the full list of versions is..
      Amiga, ST, PC, Mac ........................... #19.95 
      CPC/PCW/+3 triple-format disc ................ #19.95 
      8-bit discs: Atari XL/XE, C64, Apple II ...... #14.95 
      Tapes: CPC, Atari XL/XE, C64, MSX, Spectrum .. #14.95 

I enclose review copies, with a full play sequence and clue sheet. 
If you gneed more information, please feel free to contact me,

Dear Sir or Madam, 

         "Ingrid's Back!", Level 9's latest comedy adventure, is 
just gnow available for #14.95 on Commodore 64/128 disk and tape, 
fresh from its good reviews on 16-bit computers. In other words.. 


                   GNOME GNEWS IS GOOD GNEWS 

Latest gnews from the Level 9 camp is the Bottomlowdown on Ingrid. 
Having tamed the wilderness in "Gnome Ranger", the original Miss 
Adventure returns home to Little Moaning.. 

Ingrid's back to find the gnomes in trouble. Their happy life of 
fishing, sitting out in the rain and drinking gnome-brew, seems 
doomed by Jasper Quickbuck's plans to steam-roller the gnome-belt 
for yuppie housing. 

Can stunning Ingrid Bottomlow, she whose face could stop a thousand 
clocks, save the Gnome counties? Or is she a gnome of lost causes?  

Either way, with accident-prone Ingrid on the warpath amidst a 
mixture of puns, satire and slapstick, it's going to be fun!

Ingrid's back to find the gnomes in trouble. Their happy life of 
fishing, sitting out in the rain and drinking gnome-brew, seems 
doomed by Jasper Quickbuck's plans to steam-roller the gnome-belt 
for yuppie housing. 

Can stunning Ingrid Bottomlow, she whose face could stop a thousand 
clocks, save the Gnome counties? Or is she a gnome of lost causes?  

Either way, with accident-prone Ingrid on the warpath amidst a 
mixture of puns, satire and slapstick, it's going to be fun! 


                       TECHNICAL DETAILS 

"Ingrid's Back!" is a massive three-part adventure: the first to 
use the full power of Level 9's unique "racetracks", for the most 
lifelike gnomes ever. 

The PCW/CPC/Spectrum +3 version is on a triple-format flippy disk, 
costs #19.95 and runs on all PCWs (as well as 128K+ CPCs and +3s). 

On the PCW you get about thirty black-and-white pictures, recall

Our aim in doing a 3" triple-format disk is that shops seem not to 
stock much (or any) Spectrum disk software - but they might take a 
game that also runs on 8-bit Amstrads. The version drivers don't 
take much disk space, so this approach should benefit both Level 9

Dear Sir, 

         "Ingrid's Back!", Level 9's latest comedy adventure, is 
available on ST disk at #19.95. And all the other versions are 
available too. In other words.. 


                   GNOME GNEWS IS GOOD GNEWS 

Latest gnews from the Level 9 camp is the Bottomlowdown on Ingrid. 
Having tamed the wilderness in "Gnome Ranger", the original Miss 
Adventure returns home to Little Moaning.. 

Ingrid's back to find the gnomes in trouble. Their happy life of 
fishing, sitting out in the rain and drinking gnome-brew, seems 
doomed by Jasper Quickbuck's plans to steam-roller the gnome-belt 
for yuppie housing. 

Can stunning Ingrid Bottomlow, she whose face could stop a thousand 
clocks, save the Gnome counties? Or is she a gnome of lost causes?  

Either way, with accident-prone Ingrid on the warpath through a 
mix of puns, satire and slapstick, it's going to be fun! 


                       TECHNICAL DETAILS 

"Ingrid's Back!" is a massive three-part adventure: the first to 
use the full power of Level 9's unique "racetracks" for the most 
lifelike gnomes ever. 

The ST disk version costs #19.95. It has about 30 artist-drawn 
pictures on colour and black-and-white displays, picture cache (to 
avoid wearing out the disk like our less-sophisticated rivals), 
UNDO and RAM SAVE/RESTORE, 4 text sizes, and an auto-play feature.
