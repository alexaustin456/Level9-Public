Dear Sir/Madam, 

               "Ingrid's Back!" was very well received on 16-bit, 
(C&VG ended with "Go out and buy a copy!") and gnow the 8-bit 
versions of Level 9's latest comedy adventure are ready. 

I enclose a Commodore 64 disk version and some screen-shots. 

Here's some text prepared with the help of a PR agency (just be 
thankful I didn't send you their original!)... 


                  GNOME GNEWS IS GOOD GNEWS 

Latest gnews from the Level 9 camp is the Bottomlowdown on Ingrid. 
Having tamed the wilderness in "Gnome Ranger", the original Miss 
Adventure returns home to Little Moaning.. 

"Ingrid's Back!" is the sequel to Gnome Ranger and stars the gnomes 
of Little Moaning. Their happy life of fishing, sitting out in the 
rain and drinking gnome-brew, seems doomed by Jasper Quickbuck's 
plans to steam-roller the gnome-belt for yuppie housing. 

Can stunning Ingrid Bottomlow, she whose face could stop a thousand 
clocks, save the Gnome counties? Or is she a gnome of lost causes?  

Either way, with accident-prone Ingrid on the warpath, it's going 
to be fun! 
               *******************************

The main technical innovation is that "Ingrid's Back!" is the first 
game to use the full power of Level 9's unique "racetracks", for 
the most lifelike gnomes ever. 

                The full list of versions is..
       Amiga, ST, PC, Mac ........................... #19.95 
       CPC/PCW/+3 triple-format disc ................ #19.95 
       8-bit discs: Atari XL/XE, C64, Apple II ...... #14.95 
       Tapes: CPC, Atari XL/XE, C64, MSX, Spectrum .. #14.95 

The two Commodore 64 versions both cost #14.95. The main difference 
is that the disk version has about 30 pictures, whereas the tape 
version is text-only but has a bit more text (we don't gneed a 
graphics screen in memory and use the space for more game data).

PS: Issue 1, page 5 credits Logotron with the first multi-tasking 
game on the Amiga. They are wrong - Level 9 beat them by two years 
with "Jewels of Darkness" and "Silicon Dreams". 
                     
PPS: PG graphics article. Genuine CGA boards have a low-res mode in 
addition to the 4-colour mode mentioned. This displays 16 colours 
but is only 160 pixels across. However, not all clones which claim 
CGA compatibility support it (eg Spectrum 200).

Dear Mandy, 

           Thanks for getting in contact. When you've finished 
with "Lancelot", here's Level 9's gnew game, "Ingrid's Back!"           

Ingrid was very well received on 16-bit, (C&VG ended with "Go out 
and buy a copy!") and gnow the 8-bit versions of Level 9's latest 
comedy adventure are ready. See what you think of Dicon's pics 
(though he's probably shown you them already).
