Dear Sir, 
          "Ingrid's Back!", Level 9's latest comedy adventure, 
was well received at #19.95 on 16-bit computers and is gnow also 
available for #14.95 on 8-bit disk and tape. In other words.. 

                   GNOME GNEWS IS GOOD GNEWS 

Latest gnews from the Level 9 camp is the Bottomlowdown on Ingrid. 
Having tamed the wilderness in "Gnome Ranger", the original Miss 
Adventure returns home to Little Moaning.. 

Ingrid's back to find the gnomes in trouble. Their happy life of 
fishing, sitting out in the rain and drinking gnome-brew, seems 
doomed by Jasper Quickbuck's plans to steam-roller the gnome-belt 
for yuppie housing. 

Can stunning Ingrid Bottomlow, she whose face could stop a thousand 
clocks, save the Gnome counties? Or is she a gnome of lost causes?  

Either way, with accident-prone Ingrid on the warpath amidst a 
mixture of puns, satire and slapstick, it's going to be fun! 

                       TECHNICAL DETAILS 

"Ingrid's Back!" is a massive three-part adventure: the first to 
use the full power of Level 9's unique "racetracks", for the most 
lifelike gnomes ever. 

It uses Level 9's sophisticated adventure system, with: 
 * hand-drawn, hi-res pictures on most disk versions; 
 * advanced English parser, including go/run to, find, follow etc; 
 * true multi-person puzzles, requiring co-operation;
 * undo, ram save/restore and command recall/edit on most versions; 
 * up to 250,000 bytes of game text; unrivalled compression; 
 * picture cache to reduce disk loads. 
Etc. See the book and readme file for some more information. 

                  The full list of versions is..
      Amiga, ST, PC, Mac ........................... #19.95 
      CPC/PCW/+3 triple-format disc ................ #19.95 
      8-bit discs: Atari XL/XE, BBC, C64, Apple II . #14.95 
      Tapes: CPC, Atari XL/XE, C64, MSX, Spectrum .. #14.95 

Level 9's IBM system is constantly improving, and any US release 
would be on its next generation, which supports MCGA in addition 
to the current range of EGA, CGA (colour and monochrome), Hercules 
and text-only modes. We are considering Tandy's own modes. 

Level 9's past Rainbird and Mandarin games have been sold in the 
US, but "Gnome Ranger" (the prequel to "Ingrid's Back!") is almost 
unknown there. Bundling the two games seems a possibility.
