Dear Sir, 

          I enclose ST versions of "Ingrid's Back!" and its prequel, 
"Gnome Ranger", together with cluesheets and a play sequence. 


"Ingrid's Back!", Level 9's latest comedy adventure, was well 
received at #19.95 on 16-bit computers and is gnow also available 
for #14.95 on most 8-bit discs and tapes. In other words.. 

                   GNOME GNEWS IS GOOD GNEWS 

Latest gnews from the Level 9 camp is the Bottomlowdown on Ingrid. 
Having tamed the wilderness in "Gnome Ranger", the original Miss 
Adventure returns home to Little Moaning in this gnomespun yarn.. 

Ingrid's back to find the gnomes in trouble. Their happy life of 
fishing, sitting out in the rain and drinking gnome-brew, seems 
doomed by Jasper Quickbuck's plans to steam-roller the gnome-belt 
for yuppie housing. 

Can stunning Ingrid Bottomlow, she whose face could stop a thousand 
clocks, save the Gnome Counties? Or is she a gnome of lost causes?  

Either way, with accident-prone Ingrid on the warpath amidst a 
mixture of puns, satire and slapstick, it's going to be fun! 

                       TECHNICAL DETAILS 

"Ingrid's Back!" is a massive three-part adventure: the first to 
use the full power of Level 9's unique "racetracks", for the most 
lifelike gnomes ever. 

It uses Level 9's adventure system, genuinely the most sophisticated 
around today, with: 
 * hand-drawn, hi-res pictures on most disc versions; 
 * advanced English parser, including go/run to, find, follow etc; 
 * true multi-person puzzles, requiring co-operation;
 * undo, ram save/restore and command recall/edit on most versions; 
 * up to 250,000 bytes of game text; unrivalled compression; 
 * picture cache to reduce disc loads. 
Etc. See the book and readme file for some more information.
