Dear Sir, 

         The 16-bit versions of "Ingrid's Back!" got universally 
favourable reviews (C&VG ended with "Go out and buy a copy!") so 
I have high hopes for the 8-bit versions now coming through. 

The first 8-bit version is for the BBC Micro - and quite right too. 
And here's some text prepared with the help of a PR agency (just 
be thankful I didn't send you the original!)... 


                 "GNOME GNEWS IS GOOD GNEWS 

Latest gnews from the Level 9 camp is the Bottomlowdown on Ingrid. 
Having tamed the wilderness in 'Gnome Ranger', the original Miss 
Adventure returns home to Little Moaning.. 

Yes, 'Ingrid's Back!', in a massive three-part graphical adventure 
- the first to use the full power of Level 9's unique "racetracks" 
for the most lifelike gnomes ever. 

The BBC version runs on any expanded BBC Micro.. 
* BBC Master, 128K B+, B with shadow AND sideways RAM: pictures 
* 64K B+, B with shadow OR sideways RAM: text only. 



               The full list of versions is..
       Amiga, ST, PC, Mac ........................... #19.95 
       CPC/PCW/+3 triple-format disc ................ #19.95 
       8-bit discs: Atari XL/XE, C64, Apple II ...... #14.95 
       Tapes: CPC, Atari XL/XE, C64, MSX, Spectrum .. #14.95 

"Ingrid's Back!" is the sequel to Gnome Ranger and stars the gnomes 
of Little Moaning. Their happy life of fishing, sitting out in the 
rain and drinking gnome-brew, seems doomed by Jasper Quickbuck's 
plans to steam-roller the gnome-belt for yuppie housing. 

Can stunning Ingrid Bottomlow, she whose face could stop a thousand 
clocks, save the Gnome counties? Or is she a gnome of lost causes?  

Either way, with accident-prone Ingrid on the warpath, it's going 
to be fun! 

                   
                             Pete Austin
