Dear Beverley, 

              "Ingrid's Back!" is Level 9's latest three-part 
adventure, available on the following: 

      Amiga, ST, PC, Mac ............................ #19.95 
      CPC/PCW/+3 triple-format disc ................. #19.95 
      8-bit discs: Atari XL/XE, C64, Apple II ....... #14.95 
      Tapes: CPC, Atari XL/XE, C64, MSX, Spectrum ... #14.95 

I enclose ST and Commodore 64 versions, a sheaf of reviews, a 
play sequence and a pre-release cluesheet. 

        
             "Ingrid's Back!" is a comedy adventure, with a mix of 
puns, slapstick and topical satire about the fate of the green belt. 
With an excellent parser and adventure system, well-written text 
and artist-drawn pictures on most disc versions (not Apple II or 
Atari 8-bit), Ingrid has done very well with the reviewers. 

Some idea of the style can be gained from the following: 

                  GNOME GNEWS IS GOOD GNEWS 

Latest gnews from the Level 9 camp is the Bottomlowdown on Ingrid. 
Having tamed the wilderness in "Gnome Ranger", the original Miss 
Adventure returns home to Little Moaning.. 

"Ingrid's Back!" is the sequel to Gnome Ranger and stars the gnomes 
of Little Moaning. Their happy life of fishing, sitting out in the 
rain and drinking gnome-brew, seems doomed by Jasper Quickbuck's 
plans to steam-roller the gnome-belt for yuppie housing. 

Can stunning Ingrid Bottomlow, she whose face could stop a thousand 
clocks, save the Gnome counties? Or is she a gnome of lost causes?  

Either way, with accident-prone Ingrid on the warpath, it's going 
to be fun! 


             I'm sure that "Ingrid's Back!" will be a good game for 
BCA, as it is designed to appeal on many levels at once. Gnot only 
does it have good puzzles, but one reviewer told me that it was the 
first adventure where he had wanted to enter "Wait 50" in places, 
to watch what the other gnomes would do gnext. 

If you agree, the person to contact for orders is John Austin at 
Level 9's Weston-super-Mare offices, (0934) 814450, though you are 
welcome to 'phone Bracknell too.
