Dear Sir or Madam, 

              I enclose an IBM PC review copy of "Ingrid's Back!", 
the new three part comedy adventure from Level 9. 

The ST and Amiga versions received universally favourable reviews 
(C&VG ended by saying "Go out and buy a copy!") so I have high 
hopes for it on the PC. 

PC "Ingrid's Back!" includes both 3.5" and 5.25" discs (all Level 9 
games from now on include both common disc formats), works on every 
PC and clone we tried at the recent PC Show (about twenty, from 
Spectrum 200 to PS/2) and has graphics on all common display formats 
(EGA,VGA,CGA,Hercules - obviously EGA and VGA are the best, though). 

                 PC "Ingrid's Back!" costs #19.95.
 
                  The full list of versions is..
       Amiga, ST, PC, Mac ........................... #19.95 
       CPC/PCW/+3 triple-format disc ................ #19.95 
       8-bit discs: Atari XL/XE, C64, Apple II ...... #14.95 
       Tapes: CPC, Atari XL/XE, C64, MSX, Spectrum .. #14.95 

"Ingrid's Back!" is the sequel to Gnome Ranger and stars the gnomes 
of Little Moaning. Their happy life of fishing, sitting out in the 
rain and drinking gnome-brew, seems doomed by Jasper Quickbuck's 
plans to steam-roller the gnome-belt for yuppie housing. 

Can stunning Ingrid Bottomlow, she whose face could stop a thousand 
clocks, save the Gnome counties? Or is she a gnome of lost causes?  

Either way, with accident-prone Ingrid on the warpath, it's going 
to be fun!
