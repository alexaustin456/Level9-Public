Dear Keith...


                        GNOME RANGER II 

    I enclose a transparency to show you Ingrid's back, in the 
satirical sequel to Level 9's successful Gnome Ranger. 

Jasper Quickbuck, new lord of Ridley's Manor, is demolishing Little 
Moaning to make way for a Yuppie Homes development. Can Ingrid 
Bottomlow save the gnomes' village? Will the village then be safe 
from Ingrid's disaster-prone schemes? And what fate awaits Jasper?  

    Gnome Ranger II will be previewed at the PCW show and on sale 
mid-October, following "Lancelot". It's a three-part graphical 
adventure, published by Level 9 on 16 formats, at 19.95 pounds 
for 16-bit and 3" discs, and 14.95 pounds for 8-bit.
