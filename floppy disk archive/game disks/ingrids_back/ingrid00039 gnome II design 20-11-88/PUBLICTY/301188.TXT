Last week, I thought we were releasing the last version of 
"Ingrid's Back!", but I was wrong. We also do BBC micro versions 
with ALL the facilities of our 16-bit games - which puts them in 
a different league to other BBC adventures (at least, that's what 
I'm told Micro User's reviewer is going to say). 

            BBC disc "Ingrid's Back!" rrp #14.95 
               Will reach you Friday 2/12/88 

I think we already have an order from R&R, but please 'phone if not. 



The BBC version is on 80-track 5.25" disc and runs on all but the 
smallest micros in the family: 
* Text-only on BBC B with shadow OR sideways RAM; 64K B+ 
* Pictures on BBC B with shadow AND sideways RAM; 128K B+; Master 

Bigger BBCs have slideable pictures, ram save/restore, undo, 
picture cache, recall and editing of previous commands etc..  



No BBC reviews of Ingrid yet, but she's an Xmas Zzap sizzler and:

       |  her exploits. This is everything you would    |
       |  expect from Level 9, plus a bit more besides. |
       |  The humour floods through every location and  |
       |  action. Ingrid's Back! has been added to my   |
       |  adventure shelf forthwith and will be played  |
       |  again and again"        ...Atari ST User 9/10 |
