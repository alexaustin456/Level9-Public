We've saved the best-selling 'til last, and the final versions of 
"Ingrid's Back!" are ready: 

        Spectrum 48/128 tape "Ingrid's Back!" rrp #14.95 
   CPC/PCW/+3 triple-format disc  "Ingrid's Back!" rrp #19.95 
                  Will reach you Wednesday 16/11/88 

Please order today, or Tuesday, if you want to be sure of getting 
supplies in the first day. 


The Spectrum game contains 3 tapes, with 48K versions on the A-sides 
and 128K versions on the backs. 

The triple-format disk works on all the popular 3" disk micros: 
CPC6128, any PCW, and Spectrum +3. All have pictures. Our idea is 
that more shops should take a version if we triple its market. 
 

A major advantage of supporting the full market, as Level 9 do, is 
that dozens of 8-bit reviews are still to come, over the next few 
months, keeping Ingrid in the public eye. Meanwhile...
