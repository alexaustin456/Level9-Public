Dear Sir,

          Ingrid's Back! is the sequel to Gnome Ranger and stars 
the gnomes of Little Moaning. Their happy life of fishing, drinking 
beer, and sitting out in the rain was disturbed by bossy Ingrid 
Bottomlow; a young gnome whose "good ideas" usually went wrong. 

In Gnome Ranger, they got Ingrid to read a teleport scroll and so 
this transported her to the wilderness - where she defeated all 
the monsters easily and spent a most enjoyable "holiday". 

Meanwhile, Squire Gillpot has died, and Jasper Quickbuck has become 
the new owner of the gnomes' village of Little Moaning. He wants to 
evict the gnomes and build expensive houses for yuppies. 

Now Ingrid's back, and is the gnomes' only hope. 

          See the back of the box, and pages 16-19, for more 
details. And a full solution and some screen pictures are enclosed. 

If you need more information, please contact me. 

                        Yours faithfully, 


                                         Pete Austin
