Dear Godfrey, 

             The parcel containing the picture was languishing at the 
local sorting office when I found it today - presumably they tried to 
deliver it, but forgot to leave a card. 

Unfortunately, we have some problems with the picture. 

Basically, the gnome doesn't look much like Ingrid: she seems to have 
lost a lot of weight and become much less craggy (and, in passing, 
her posture is still as in the original rough). 

To be specific, the new Ingrid:
* needs bushier hair and eyebrows (and a lower hair-line),
* her face should be fatter and less smooth, regaining the bulging 
  cheeks, dark bags around the eyes and deep lines of the old,
* her nose should be flatter and more potato-like, 
* how about adding back her ladybird necklace, 
* her neck and arm should become more muscular, 
* she is too long in the back, and should be shortened (or, as an 
  alternative, her waist and belt should be raised). 
* she should be fatter while, in contrast, her legs (which are 
  unnaturally wide and smooth) should become a bit thinner and a bit 
  bulgy where the material criss-crosses around them,  
* her shoes should have more detail. 

If you need to redraw Ingrid, please make her turn more at the waist 
and less at the neck, otherwise I'm prepared to stick with her current 
posture. 

                      Best wishes, 


                                  Pete Austin
