      GNOME RANGER II RACETRACKS. COPYRIGHT (C) 1988 LEVEL 9
      ------------------------------------------------------

This part of the design gave some ideas for the most important 
racetracks, and indicated "none" when they were less necessary. 
The important thing, though, was for the game to have enough 
action and movement that it "came to life".
