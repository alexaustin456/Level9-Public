This Agreement, made this 6th day of August 1988, is by and between: 

Level 9 Computing                       Dicon Peeke
(partners: PRJ, MJA and NWA Austin)     of Tyn Lon 
of 5-11 Mendip Road                     Llanfairynghornwy 
Bracknell                               Anglesey 
Berks RG12 3XG                          North Wales 
(hereinafter known as Level 9)          (hereinafter known as Dicon)

Whereas Dicon is a self-employed artist creating computer pictures, 
and Level 9 are in the business of writing computer games which 
include pictures. 

1) Dicon undertakes to produce for Level 9, using his own equipment 
and facilities, sufficient pictures for four games a year (based on 
30 pictures per game, each picture with a version on the Atari ST 
and another on the Commodore 64). The games specified by Level 9.  

2) In return, Level 9 will pay Dicon #1,000 per month, on the 15th 
of each month, for work done since the previous payment. (However, 
the first payment of all will be made as soon as possible after the 
signing of this contract.) Dicon remains self-employed and 
responsible for his own tax etc. 

3) Dicon will not do work which might conflict with that for Level 9, 
without Level 9's prior written agreement. 

4) Work can be substituted by prior mutual agreement. In other words, 
if both parties agree, Dicon can do other types of artwork under this 
agreement (e.g pen and ink sketches) in place of some of the computer 
pictures. 

5) This agreement can be cancelled by either party giving 1 month's 
notice, unless more than a month is needed to finish the pictures 
for the current game. In this case, the notice period is the shorter 
of 3 months, or until the completion of the pictures for the game.
