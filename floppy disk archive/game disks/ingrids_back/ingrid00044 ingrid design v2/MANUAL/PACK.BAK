Ingrid Bottomlow was first featured in "Gnome Ranger" and returns 
in "Gnome Free" in May 1989. Both games are available from Level 9,  
for virtually any computer.

[Back of Outer sleeve] 

House prices are soaring and Jasper Quickbuck, insider-dealing lord 
of Ridley's Manor, plans to steamroller the gnome-belt village of 
Little Moaning for a Yuppie Homes development. 

To complete the dismay of the gnomes, walking disaster Ingrid 
Bottomlow is back from her enforced "holiday" in the wilderness. 

When immovable market forces meet the irresistable Ingrid, will 
there be a u-turn? Or will humour be the only winner? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Gnome II is the first game to use the full power of Level 9's 
unique "racetracks", for the most lifelike gnomes ever. And it has:
* hand-drawn hi-res pictures on most disc versions; 
* advanced English parser, including go/run to, find, follow etc; 
* true multi-character puzzles, requiring co-operation; 
* ram save/restore and undo on most versions; 
* up to 60,000 words of game text.
