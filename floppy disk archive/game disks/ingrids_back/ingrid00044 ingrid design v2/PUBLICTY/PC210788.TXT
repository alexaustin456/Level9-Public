Dear Harriet, 

             Sorry the first catalogue entry was too long. I hope 
this version is better.                       Regards, Pete Austin.

See the next generation Level 9 adventures, LANCELOT and GNOME II 
for Amiga, IBM PC, Mac, ST, CPC/PCW/+3, Apple II, Atari XL/XE, 
CBM 64, MSX, Spectrum, BBC, at #19.95 (16-bit) and #14.95 (8-bit). 

* Hand-drawn hi-res pictures on most discs; 
* up to 60,000 words of game text and an accompanying book; 
* high-level commands: go/run to, find, follow, wait for etc; 
* true multi-character features and unique puzzles; 
* ram save/restore and undo. 

    "LANCELOT", new for the show, is based faithfully on the 
Arthurian legends. Months of research have produced a design whose 
language retains the flavour of the original stories, where people 
and events come straight from the legends, and which blends classic 
adventure puzzles with conundrums from chivalry. 

    "GNOME II", previewed ahead of its October launch, is the 
satirical sequel to Gnome Ranger. Jasper Quickbuck, insider-dealing 
lord of Ridley's Manor, intends to steamroller the gnome belt for a 
Yuppie Homes development...
