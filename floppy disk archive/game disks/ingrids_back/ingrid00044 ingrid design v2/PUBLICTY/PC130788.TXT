    "LANCELOT", new for the show, is based faithfully on the 
Arthurian legends from Malory's "Morte D'Arthur". Pete Austin has 
put months of research into a design whose language retains the 
flavour of the original stories, where people and events come 
straight from the legends, and which has a mix of traditional 
adventure puzzles and those from chivalry. 

You play Lancelot: his knighting by Arthur; the valiant deeds
which madehim "Best Knight in the Land"; his doomed affaires 
with Guenever, and his success in the quest for the Holy Grail. 

    "GNOME II", previewed ahead of its October launch, is the 
satirical sequel to Level 9's successful Gnome Ranger, in which 
Ingrid Bottomlow horrifies the inhabitants of Little Moaning by 
managing to return home there. 

Jasper Quickbuck, insider-dealing lord of Ridley's Manor, plans 
to steamroll this quiet corner of the gnome belt for a Yuppie 
Homes development, and only accident-prone Ingrid can save it.
