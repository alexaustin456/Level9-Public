Dear Sir/Madam, 

               Level 9 are going solo again, and launching four 
new games, evenly spaced through each year. We're going for the 
highest possible quality of game and graphics. Packaging is 
standardising on Rainbird/Acornsoft-sized boxes (see sample) and 
we have put the the title on every face so the box can be 
displayed whichever way round is the current fashion. 


"Ingrid's Back!" is the first of these games; previewed at the PCW 
show, we have timed its launch to match the first reviews, which 
seem universally good (quotes from current or next issues): 

    "The most enjoyable Level 9 adventure to date - go 
     out and buy a copy" ........................ C&VG

    "It gets all 9's and 10's" 
                     .. spokesperson for Atari ST User

    "The graphics ... are bursting with warmth" 
           Rated 920, the best game in the current ACE

    "The most compelling and creative adventure from 
    Level 9 yet .. a SIZZLER" ................... Zzap 


Main versions are..                          r.r.p   released 
    Amiga, ST, PC .......................... #19.95. 26/10/88
