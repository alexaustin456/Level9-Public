Dear Sirs, 

          Here are: a review copy of "Ingrid's Back!", the new 
three-part comedy adventure from Level 9. 

Versions are... 
   Amiga, ST, PC, Mac ........................... #19.95. 26/10/88
   CPC/PCW/+3 triple-format 3" disc ............. #19.95.  2/11/88 
   Discs: Atari XL/XE, C64, Apple II ............ #14.95.  2/11/88 
   Tapes: CPC, Atari XL/XE, C64, MSX, Spectrum .. #14.95.  2/11/88 

All disc versions, except Atari XL/XE and Apple II, have pictures.

          Ingrid's Back! is the sequel to Gnome Ranger and stars 
the gnomes of Little Moaning. Their happy life of fishing, drinking 
beer, and sitting out in the rain was disturbed by bossy Ingrid 
Bottomlow; a young gnome whose "good ideas" usually went wrong. 

In Gnome Ranger, they got Ingrid to read a teleport scroll and so 
this transported her to the wilderness - where she defeated all 
the monsters easily and spent a most enjoyable "holiday". 

Meanwhile, Squire Gillpot has died, and Jasper Quickbuck has become 
the new owner of the gnomes' village of Little Moaning. He wants to 
evict the gnomes and build expensive houses for yuppies. 

Now Ingrid's back, and is the gnomes' only hope. 

          "Ingrid's Back!" has been described as "the most 
enjoyable Level 9 adventure to date", so I hope you like it too. 

See the back of the box, and pages 16-19, for more details. And a 
full solution and some screen pictures are enclosed

If you need more information, please contact me. 

                        Yours faithfully,
