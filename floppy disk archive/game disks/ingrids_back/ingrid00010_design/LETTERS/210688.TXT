Dear Sir/Madam, 

                 I gather that you provide a service for typesetting 
computer documents, and would be interested in details. 

As part of Level 9's business as games publishers, we produce manuals, 
adverts etc on the Macintosh. 

To get the best possible quality, I are interested in finding a 
local firm who can take the already-formatted documents and print 
them on professional typesetting equipment. 

Please supply details, including typical costs. 

                       Yours faithfully, 


                                        Pete Austin 
                                        Partner
