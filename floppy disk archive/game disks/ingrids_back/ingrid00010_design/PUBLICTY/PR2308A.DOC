Dear Sir or Madam, 


                          INGRID'S BACK! 

Well, gnearly... But the programming's finished and the printers 
are doing their thing (probably on the beach, if you ask me) and 
Gnettlefield's answer to Fergie will hit the shops in mid-October. 

In the meantime, I enclose some screen-shots from the game, showing 
the sophisticated and elegant gnomes at play. 


Ingrid's Back! is the sequel to Gnome Ranger, and stars the gnomes of 
Little Moaning as they go about their busy lives. Fishing, drinking, 
sitting out in the rain, that sort of thing.. 

But this idyllic existence is about to come to an end. Faced by two 
perils, the plots of Jasper Quickbuck of Ridley's Manor, and the 
"good ideas" of stunning Ingrid Bottomlow, can Little Moaning survive? 


Ingrid's Back! Review copies will go out around the PCW show and 
it will be on sale in mid-October. It's a three-part graphical 
adventure, published by Level 9 on 16 formats, at #19.95 for 16-bit 
and 3" discs, and #14.95 for 8-bit.

Dear Sir, 


                          INGRID'S BACK! 

Well, gnearly... But the programming's finished and the printers 
are doing their thing (probably on the beach, if you ask me) and 
Gnettlefield's answer to Fergie will hit the shops in mid-October. 

In the meantime, I enclose some screen-shots from the game, showing 
the sophisticated and elegant gnomes at play. 


Ingrid's Back! is the sequel to Gnome Ranger, and stars the gnomes of 
Little Moaning as they go about their busy lives. Fishing, drinking, 
sitting out in the rain, that sort of thing.. 

But this idyllic existence is about to come to an end. Faced by two 
perils, the plots of Jasper Quickbuck of Ridley's Manor, and the 
"good ideas" of stunning Ingrid Bottomlow, can Little Moaning survive? 


Ingrid's Back! Review copies will go out around the PCW show and 
it will be on sale in mid-October. It's a three-part graphical 
adventure, published by Level 9 on 16 formats, at #19.95 for 16-bit 
and 3" discs, and #14.95 for 8-bit.
