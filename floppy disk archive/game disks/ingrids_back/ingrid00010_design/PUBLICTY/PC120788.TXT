    "LANCELOT", released for the show, is based faithfully on 
the Arthurian legends from Malory's "Morte D'Arthur". You will 
be relieved to know that the game does not have Merlin throwing 
fireballs, or heavy metal orcs for that matter. 

Pete Austin has put months of research into a design whose 
language retains the flavour of the original stories, where 
people and events come straight from the legends, and which has 
a mix of traditional adventure puzzles and those from chivalry. 

You play Lancelot: his knighting by Arthur; the valiant quests 
which earnt the title of "Best Knight in the Land"; his doomed 
affairs with Elaine and Guenever, and his success in the quest 
for the Holy Grail. 

    "GNOME II", previewed ahead of its October launch, is the 
satirical sequel to Level 9's successful Gnome Ranger. Jasper 
Quickbuck, insider-dealing lord of Ridley's Manor, plans to 
steamroll the "gnome belt" for a Yuppie Homes development.
