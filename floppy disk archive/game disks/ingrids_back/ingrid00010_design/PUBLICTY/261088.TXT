Dear Alan, 

          When we met at the PC Show, you were good enough to point 
out that "Spook", which we intended to use for the next Level 9 
game, was not especially suitable for the USA. Thanks for your 
help - the game will be launched next year, titled "Scapeghost". 

          Meanwhile, Level 9 are just launching "Ingrid's Back!", 
the adventure that we previewed at the show. It seems to be doing 
well with the reviewers and I wondered if you'd like to consider 
it for Woolworths or perhaps the USA. 

"Ingrid's Back!" is a topical humorous adventure (present-day 
adventures seem to be in fashion just now). It's the second in 
the Gnome Ranger series, and features the fight by anti-heroine 
Ingrid Bottomlow to save Little Moaning and the gnome belt from 
being steamrollered for yuppies. It has up to 300K of text, lots 
of good hand-drawn pictures and is very funny. 

The launch is timed to match the first reviews:
