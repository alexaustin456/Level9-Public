Dear Sir, 

                  Cluesheets for Level 9's most recent games, 
"Lancelot" and "Ingrid's Back!" are both now available, and I 
enclose a copy of each.   


                  After-sales service is regrettably rare in the 
computer games business. After all, to take a cynical view, why 
spend money to help people who have already bought a game?.. They 
are not going to buy second copies. 

So perhaps it is not too surprising that Level 9 are still the only 
publishers that I know of giving away comprehensive free cluesheets 
for adventure games; six years after we pioneered the idea. (To get 
one, return the coupon in each game). 

I've got quicker with practice, but it still costs several thousand 
pounds, in time and printing costs, to produce a new cluesheet. Some 
people might think this money wasted, but I prefer to think that 
extras such as free cluesheets are one reason why Level 9 are still 
around after all these years. 


                          Best wishes, 


                                      Pete Austin

Dear Keith, 

                  Cluesheets for Level 9's most recent games, 
"Lancelot" and "Ingrid's Back!" are both now available, and I 
enclose a copy of each.   


                  After-sales service is regrettably rare in the 
computer games business. After all, to take a cynical view, why 
spend money to help people who have already bought a game?.. They 
are not going to buy second copies. 

So perhaps it is not too surprising that Level 9 are still the only 
publishers that I know of giving away comprehensive free cluesheets 
for adventure games; six years after we pioneered the idea. (To get 
one, return the coupon in each game). 

I've got quicker with practice, but it still costs several thousand 
pounds, in time and printing costs, to produce a new cluesheet. Some 
people might think this money wasted, but I prefer to think that 
extras such as free cluesheets are one reason why Level 9 are still 
around after all these years. 


                          Best wishes, 


                                      Pete Austin

Dear Peter, 

                  Cluesheets for Level 9's most recent games, 
"Lancelot" and "Ingrid's Back!" are both now available, and I 
enclose a copy of each.   


                  After-sales service is regrettably rare in the 
computer games business. After all, to take a cynical view, why 
spend money to help people who have already bought a game?.. They 
are not going to buy second copies. 

So perhaps it is not too surprising that Level 9 are still the only 
publishers that I know of giving away comprehensive free cluesheets 
for adventure games; six years after we pioneered the idea. (To get 
one, return the coupon in each game). 

I've got quicker with practice, but it still costs several thousand 
pounds, in time and printing costs, to produce a new cluesheet. Some 
people might think this money wasted, but I prefer to think that 
extras such as free cluesheets are one reason why Level 9 are still 
around after all these years. 


                          Best wishes, 


                                      Pete Austin

I've got quicker with practice, but it still costs several thousand

extras such as free cluesheets are one reason why Level 9 are still 
around after all these years.

Dear Sir or Madam, 

                  Cluesheets for Level 9's most recent games, 
"Lancelot" and "Ingrid's Back!" are both now available, and I 
enclose a copy of each.   


                  After-sales service is regrettably rare in the 
computer games business. After all, to take a cynical view, why 
spend money to help people who have already bought a game?.. They 
are not going to buy second copies. 

So perhaps it is not too surprising that Level 9 are still the only 
publishers that I know of giving away comprehensive free cluesheets 
for adventure games; six years after we pioneered the idea. (To get 
one, return the coupon in each game). 

I've got quicker with practice, but it still costs several thousand 
pounds, in time and printing costs, to produce a new cluesheet. Some 
people might think this money wasted, but I prefer to think that 
extras such as free cluesheets are one reason why Level 9 are still 
around after all these years. 


                          Best wishes, 


                                      Pete Austin
