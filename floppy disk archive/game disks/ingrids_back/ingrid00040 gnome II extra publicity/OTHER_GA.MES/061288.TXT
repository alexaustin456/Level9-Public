Dear Sir, 

         Regarding your fax of yesterday, about overstocks. They 
are not exactly overstocks, but you might consider the adventures 
"Gnome Ranger" and "Ingrid's Back!" 


The full list of versions is:                    Gnome   Ingrid's
                                                 Ranger  Back! 
  Amiga, ST, PC, Mac ........................... #14.95  #19.95 
  CPC/PCW/+3 triple-format disc ................ #14.95  #19.95 
  8-bit discs: Atari XL/XE, BBC, C64, Apple II .  #9.95  #14.95 
  Tapes: CPC, Atari XL/XE, C64, MSX, Spectrum ..  #9.95  #14.95 
(All disc versions have pictures, apart from XL/XE and Apple II)

Both are 3-part comedy adventures and were very well received on 
launch ("Gnome Ranger" late in 1987 and "Ingrid's Back!" in 1988) 
and both feature a mix of puns, satire and slapstick about gnomes. 

Ingrid did especially well: "the funniest series of adventures 
ever to grace your ST" - Atari ST User; A sizzler - Zzap; "Go out 
and buy a copy!" - Computer & Video Games


We are limited by a contract not to undercut BCA; the games each 
have a booklet which they refer to for copy-protection, so there 
are limitations on repackaging them, if you intend this; and 
"Ingrid's Back!" is brand new, so we would not be able to consider 
small quantities lest we offend other distributers who would then 
be paying more for similar orders. But if you are still interested 
then please contact me on the number above, or John Austin on 
0934 814450. 


                       Best wishes, 



                                   Pete Austin
