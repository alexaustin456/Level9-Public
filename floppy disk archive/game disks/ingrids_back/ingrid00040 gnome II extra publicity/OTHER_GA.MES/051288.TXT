Dear Andrew, 

            It's been a difficult decision, but I'm not sure that 
it would be the right thing for Level 9 to offer you a job. 


            It became clear to me some while ago that you would 
require and deserve a firm guarantee of long-term employment with 
Level 9 before leaving your existing employment. 

Level 9's future depends on the level of sales. And, while recent 
sales have not been bad, they are borderline as regards Level 9's 
expansion plans. Unfortunately, the versions released before your 
latest visit did relatively well (hence my confidence at that time), 
while some of the later versions did relatively badly, and this 
made an accurate decision impossible until the launch was finished. 


            I also feel that the downside risk would be relatively 
high in your case. Level 9 might find ourselves in a last-in-first 
-out situation if we needed to cut costs. And, should we stop 
publishing, our specialist artists and programmers would have no 
difficulty in finding similar jobs. But your job would have been 
less technical - at least until you got back into the swing of 
programming - and therefore you would have more problems. 


            It is only now that I have the full picture, and there 
is sufficient uncertainty that I don't think it would be fair to 
ask you to move career and area in the circumstances. 

I'm sorry, but Level 9 cannot offer you a job. But if I can help in 
any way short of this, then please ask. 


                            Yours sincerely, 



                                             Pete Austin
