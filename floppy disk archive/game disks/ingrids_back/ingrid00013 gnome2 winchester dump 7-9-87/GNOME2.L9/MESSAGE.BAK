; MESSAGE.TXT, messages/keywords for the game.   
;
; Messages are of the form: [ number : text ] ; comment
; They must be in numeric order, but gaps are allowed in the number 
; sequence, of course.
;
; | (vertical bar) terminates the printable part of a message. It 
;   is typed by shifting backslash (to the left of the keyboard).
; / forces the following character to be printed literally. 
; % is carriage return. Note that carriage return is ignored if 
;   the printing is already at the start of a line, to make coding 
;   simpler. To force a real carriage return, print space first.
; ^ (shift 6) marks a word for recognition by the parser. It is 
;   followed by a letter for word type: 
;   Adjective; Comment; conJunction; Noun; Preposition; Verb. 
;
; The word type ^C is used when a word is not to be used as part of 
; the normal parsing but is to be available for checking should it 
; be needed. This is so references to scenery may be checked for
; containing particular words.
;
; Capitalisation is done automatically on output and you are 
; recommended to use lower case for the first letter of messages 
; as this improves compression and will make no difference on 
; output, providing all punctuation is correct. 
;
; punctuation messages..
