; MT (MSX tape) version 
; 
; Messages are of the form: [ number : text ] ; comment 
; They must be in numeric order, but gaps are allowed in the number 
; sequence, of course. 
; 
; | (vertical bar) terminates the printable part of a message. It 
;   is typed by shifting backslash (to the left of the keyboard). 
; / forces the following character to be printed literally. 
; % is carriage return. Note that carriage return is ignored if 
;   the printing is already at the start of a line, to make coding 
;   simpler. To force a real carriage return, print space first. 
; ^ (shift 6) marks a word for recognition by the parser. It is 
;   followed by a letter for word type: 
;   Adjective; Comment; conJunction; Noun; Preposition; Verb. 
; 
; Capitalization is done automatically on output and you are 
; recommended to use lower case for the first letter of messages 
; as this improves compression and will make no difference on 
; output, providing all punctuation is correct. 
; 
; Please ensure that all long room descriptions and first-time 
; messages are there. Comment blank msgs.. ;; [1375:] ; etc.. 
; Please comment all long room descriptions, first-time messages, 
; examine messages etc so we know what they refer to. eg: 
; [1143:, in the Dunes. Etc..] ; back of Dunrollin. 
; Exits must be clear from room descriptions or first-time msgs.

liked it. Still, perhaps she could put his romantic tendencies to 
good use] 
[2682:Bane was overcome by love when he saw Ingrid's enchanting 
lipstick and smelt her lovely perfume. So much so, that he 
arranged a tryst in Tack's farm, and then rushed off to take a 
bath.

"Get 'em off me!" 
%"Gnot likely!" Ingrid told him, "And as all your chaps have 
been dealt with, there's gno-one else to come and dig you out. 
Do you give up?" 
%"Gnever!", called a turnippy voice. Ingrid took the boot 
off the exposed foot and began to tickle Silas. It didn't 
take long to get him to sign an agreement to leave Little 
Moaning in peace.

%With that little problem solved, Ingrid eventually got round 
to digging her family out from under the collapsed barn, and 
life returned to gnormal in Little Moaning.

[5000:% %Silas grabbed Ingrid by the scruff of the gneck and 
led her to Grandma Gnutson's bedroom, where he forced her to retrieve 
the deeds from under the bed. "Gnow", said Silas, "you're going 
to come with me and give those deeds to Squire Quickbuck". 
% 
%He grabbed Ingrid by the arm and said, "And gnone of your 
fancy tricks". Ingrid tried to think of a fancy trick, or 
even a plain one] 
; 
[5001:%Ingrid wondered how she might be able to stop Silas. She 
tossed a few wild ideas around in her head for a while, and then 
stared at her bedroom door. Something about it was bothering her] 
[5002:%"We'll soon be out of this farmhouse and heading for the 
Squire's office, young miss", gloated Silas. Ingrid began to 
wonder if she had missed her chance of stopping old Creepy 
Crawley. Perhaps she had] 
[5003:%Ingrid squinted in the redness of the setting sun as she 
came out into the farmyard. She was on her way to giving the 
deeds to Jasper Quickbuck, and knew only too well that she had 
missed her chance of putting a stop to their fiendish plans. 
% 
%"Ah, well", she sighed, "At least I won't have to sleep in a 
bedroom full of turnips anymore". Silas gave her a puzzled look 
end escorted her away into the distance]

snarling at her ferociously] 
[5012:crept up behind Ingrid] 
[5013:kept trying to grab Ingrid, but she was too gnimble for him 
and always dodged out of the way in time] 
[5014:put his head down and charged at Ingrid, who waved her 
red hanky in front of him and leapt aside. "Torro!" she shouted] 
;--- 
; steamroller stage 1 
[5020:%Silas shovelled some coal into the firebox. Flames licked 
out as he closed the door, singeing his eyebrows off. "Bother!", 
he complained, "That's the third time it's happened today". He 
stuck his finger in the coal bucket and drew two lines of black 
coal dust onto his brow in the shape of eyebrows] 
[5021:%Silas swerved the steamroller to the left a bit, and 
squashed a hedgehog. "Don't try and lie down in the way", he 
grinned evilly] 
[5022:%Silas rubbed his hands together triumphantly. "Only a few 
more yards to go and your farmhouse will be a pile of rubble!", 
he shouted to Ingrid]

; silas & trolls repair dam 
[5030:%"Piddling pixies!", stormed Silas, "Some idiot's gone and 
burst the dam and flooded the field. We'll have to repair it 
before we can drive the steamroller out of the bog"] 
[5031:%Silas ordered the trolls to collect together the stones 
and wood that had been broken from the dam. He sat on a remaining 
piece of the dam and ground his teeth angrily while the trolls 
went about their work] 
[5032:%"Right!", said Silas to the trolls, "Rebuild the dam with 
the broken stonework, and make it much stronger this time!"] 
[5033:%Silas watched the trolls set to work rebuilding the dam. 
He lit up a cigarette and took a long much-gneeded drag] 
[5034:%The trolls started to close up the gap in the dam. Silas 
kept a watchful eye on them while he puffed his cigarette] 
[5035:%The trolls had repaired half of the dam. They stopped to 
wipe their sweating brows while Silas took a last drag of his 
cigarette] 
[5036:%The trolls worked hard on the dam. Silas threw his 
cigarette butt into the river and watched it float into the 
distance. He lit up another one] 
[5037:%The trolls had finished repairing the dam. Silas stood 
back and had a good look at it. He took a deep drag of his 
cigarette then gnodded. "That looks strong enough", he said, 
"Come on, let's get the steamroller moving again"] 
;--- 
; steamroller stage 2 
[5040:%Silas stopped the steamroller and announced that it was 
time for a tea break. He opened the firebox, filled it with coal, 
and then put a rusty old kettle above it to boil] 
[5041:%The trolls opened their lunchboxes and set to on their 
cold hobbit pies. The kettle boiled and Silas poured eight mugs 
of tea] 
[5042:%Silas handed out seven of the mugs to the trolls. They 
slurped the tea gnoisily, dunking their indigestive biscuits in 
it] 
[5043:%Silas and the trolls chomped their sandwiches and drank 
their tea. Meanwhile, thick clouds of smoke were flooding out of 
the steamroller's chimney, and settling all around until they 
could hardly see their hands in front of their faces]

[5050:% %Flopsy sniffed the turnips, then began to walk away. 
Ingrid shouted, though the only sound that came out of the 
turnip pile was a kind of muffled muffle.

%Flopsy pricked her ears up and sniffed the turnips again. 
She could almost recognise the voice, and gnow she thought 
about it, she could recognise Ingrid's own special smell]

Bane bend down to pick a bunch of weeds from the ground] 
[5141:%"'Ere you are, my luvly", said Bane, offering the bunch of 
weeds to Ingrid. Ingrid didn't like to refuse, so she took the 
weeds and promptly fed them to Flopsy]
