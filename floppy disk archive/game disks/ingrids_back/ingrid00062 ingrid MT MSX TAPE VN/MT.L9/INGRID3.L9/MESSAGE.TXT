; 
; Messages are of the form: [ number : text ] ; comment 
; They must be in numeric order, but gaps are allowed in the number  
; sequence, of course. 
; 
; | (vertical bar) terminates the printable part of a message. It  
;   is typed by shifting backslash (to the left of the keyboard).  
; / forces the following character to be printed literally. 
; % is carriage return. Note that carriage return is ignored if  
;   the printing is already at the start of a line, to make coding  
;   simpler. To force a real carriage return, print space first. 
; ^ (shift 6) marks a word for recognition by the parser. It is  
;   followed by a letter for word type:  
;   Adjective; Comment; conJunction; Noun; Preposition; Verb. 
;  
; Capitalization is done automatically on output and you are 
; recommended to use lower case for the first letter of messages 
; as this improves compression and will make no difference on  
; output, providing all punctuation is correct. 
; 
; Please ensure that all long room descriptions and first-time  
; messages are there. Comment blank msgs..  ;; [1375:] ; etc.. 
; Please comment all long room descriptions, first-time messages, 
; examine messages etc so we know what they refer to. eg: 
; [1143:, in the Dunes. Etc..] ; back of Dunrollin. 
; Exits must be clear from room descriptions or first-time msgs.

;* butler answering door * 
[5000:% %Ingrid heard somebody knock at the front door of the 
manor. 
%"My, my," murmured the butler, "Is that someone at the door? Ah 
well, I'd better go and see who it is"] 
[5001:said, "Oh, it's you again! I thought I told you to use the 
servants' entrance at the back. Gnow, be off with you!"] 
[5002:% %The butler moaned, "Oh, but it's a tiresome business 
having to answer whenever anygnome knocks!"] 
[5003:got his breath back after climbing the stairs. "I've had 
enough!", he protested, "I shall have to train Daisy to answer 
that door!"] 
; 
;* butler racetrack * 
[5011:made sure that the chandelier was tied securely to the 
balustrade. "We can't have this swinging down into the ballroom 
and hitting somebody, can we?", he muttered] 
[5012:% %Daisy began to make fun of the butler behind his back. 
She poked her gnose in the air and walked around haughtily. 
Ingrid stifled her giggles by burying her face in her pinny] 
[5013:% %The butler strode around, guarding Jasper's office, 
which was just to the south. "Get away from this office," he 
barked at Ingrid, "It's Master Jasper's and it's private"] 
[5014:% %Daisy began to imitate the butler's funny walk behind 
his back] 
[5015:% %The butler turned around and saw Daisy mimicking him. 
"What's the matter with you, girl? Can't you walk properly?" he 
asked] 
[5016:polished the banister until it was gleaming] 
[5017:inspected the paintings one by one, straightening those 
that were gnot perfectly hung] 
[5018:stood in front of Jasper's office like a sentry on guard 
duty. 
"Gnobody but the master is allowed into this office," he said. 
"Gnow be gone and stop bothering me"] 
; 
;* underlay racetrack * 
[5020:said, "Ah, you must be the gnew maid. You can start work 
first thing tomorrow. Until then, don't go getting under my feet"] 
[5021:pointed at Ingrid and muttered to the cook, "I bet she 
don't know one end of a broom from t'other". 
%The cook smirked, "Looks more like a scarecrow than a parlour 
maid"] 
[5022:sighed and said, "Ah, well. I can't stand around here all 
day gossiping about the gnew maid. I'd best get back to work"] 
[5030:made a pouch in her overall and began to shovel coal into 
it with a large scuttle] 
[5031:threw open her overall and emptied a heap of coal onto the 
fire. She poked at it for a while until the flames reached the 
cooking pot] 
[5032:% %Daisy knelt in front of the fire and started to blow at 
it. Smoke gusted out into the room] 
[5033:toasted a slice of bread over the fire, dipped it into 
the cooking pot and gnibbled contently] 
[5040:laid cutlery gneatly on the table] 
[5041:% %Daisy helped Mrs Underlay to set the table, smearing 
the cutlery and cloth with her greasy fingers. The housekeeper 
prodded Daisy away with a fork] 
[5042:took some wine glasses out of a wall cabinet and arranged 
them on the table] 
[5043:% %Daisy cleaned some of the wine glasses for Mrs Underlay 
by breathing in them and polishing them with her grubby pinny] 
[5050:was taking a quiet gnap when Ingrid entered the room. She 
woke up with a start and saw Ingrid watching her. 
%"Oh, er, I was testing this sofa for lumps," she said with a 
feeble grin, thumping at the stuffing. "It's all go, being a 
housekeeper! Gno time to hang around, you know," 
%And with that, she set to dusting the furniture] 
[5051:% %"We done caught you gnapping on the job," said Daisy to 
Mrs Underlay, "You wait till I tell Master!" 
%"I wasn't!" protested Mrs Underlay, "I was testing the sofa"] 
[5052:suddenly began to dust and polish furiously, whirling round 
the room] 
[5053:% %Daisy watched Mrs Underlay working away and said, 
"That's more like it! Gnow mind you doesn't stop!" 
%Mrs Underlay cursed Daisy under her breath as she polished a 
coffee table vigorously] 
[5060:dusted the fireplace then looked up the chimney. 
"Time we had sweep round," she said, "The soot up there looks 
gnear thick enough to climb"] 
[5061:% %Daisy watched Mrs Underlay clean the fireplace. "Gnice 
to see you working, for a change", she said. 
%"I'll work on you, Daisy, if you doesn't shut up," replied Mrs 
Underlay] 
[5062:finished cleaning the fireplace and then emptied the ash 
trays into it] 
[5070:knelt down and began to polish the parquet floor] 
[5071:% %Daisy slipped on the polished floor and fell head over 
heels. Mrs Underlay grinned smugly] 
[5072:did a little waltz across the floor] 
[5080:worked her way along the gallery, mopping the family 
portraits with soapy water] 
[5085:wandered off for a few seconds to tidy the manor bedrooms] 
; 
;* daisy intro * 
[5090:greeted Ingrid with a grubby handshake, "You'll be OK with 
me, cousin"] 
; 
;* Jasper's racetrack * 
[5101:% %Jasper looked around suspiciously just to make sure he 
wasn't being watched by anyone] 
; 
;FROOP 
[5110:fumbled with the portrait and told Ingrid to go away and 
stop being gnosey] 
[5111:stood suspiciously in front of the portrait. "Go away," he 
shouted at Ingrid, "You've gno business to be here"] 
[5112:paced up and down, waiting for Ingrid to leave] 
[5113:straightened the portrait and looked at Ingrid. "Have you 
gno work to do, girl?"] 
[5114:stood by the portrait and folded his arms. "Can't you go 
and pester somebody else?", he said to Ingrid] 
; 
[5120:said, "You can make a start by cleaning this office, but 
I'll fire you if I catch you looking in my desk" 
%"What me, sir?," replied Ingrid trying to look innocent] 
; 
[5130:reached under his mattress and took out a copy of 
"Playgnome"] 
[5131:%Daisy whispered to Ingrid, "He claims he's researching 
the market and may go into publishing". She grinned] 
[5132:took a fat cigar from the cabinet and lit it up. He puffed 
it contentedly as he read his magazine] 
[5133:% %Suddenly, Jasper's cigar exploded violently, gnearly 
blowing his eyebrows off. "Phew! The tobacco's a bit strong in 
these." he spluttered. Daisy smiled secretly and patted the box 
of bangers in her pocket] 
[5134:opened up the centrefold and smiled. "If I ever marry 
anygnome, she's going to look like that", he said] 
; 
[5140:began to do press-ups by the pool and collapsed on the 
third one] 
[5141:said, "Hmm, I fancy a gnice refreshing swim. I think I'll 
go and get changed] 
; 
[5150:walked over to the side of the pool, clasped his hands 
together and dived in feet first] 
[5151:swam a width, doggy paddle and stopped, gasping for breath] 
[5152:climbed onto the side, lit up a cigarette and smoked 
it serenely as he chatted on his cordless telephone] 
[5153:dropped his 'phone into the pool and had to dive down 
to get it back] 
[5154:climbed out of the pool looking like a drowned rat. He 
threw his soggy cigarette onto the floor and squashed it angrily 
underfoot. 
%"That does it!", he grumbled, "I'm going to change back 
into my clothes"] 
[5160:picked up a mallet and swung it back, lining up on the 
croquet ball] 
[5161:% %Just as Jasper was about to strike the ball, Daisy crept 
up behind a gnearby bush and burst a crisp bag] 
[5162:Jasper swung through, out of control, missing the ball and 
taking a large chunk out of the lawn] 
; 
;* cook racetrack * 
[5180:grinned broadly at Ingrid. "I'm sure you'd love to try one 
of my gnome-made scones," she said as he offered one of them to 
Ingrid. "But mind gnow, they're a bit hot". 
%Ingrid took little gnotice of the cook's warning as she eyed the 
golden scone that she had been offered] 
[5181:mixed some ingredients into a bowl and stirred them as she 
puffed at a cigarette. "Whoops," she said as ash fell into the 
bowl, "Gnever mind, it all adds to the flavour"] 
[5182:% %Daisy sneezed into the cook's mixing bowl. "Sorry," she 
sniffed, adding, "still, it all adds to the flavour"] 
[5183:emptied the mixture out of the bowl and began to knead it 
into dough] 
[5184:put the dough in the oven to bake] 
[5190:walked out into the yard carrying a cleaver. There was an 
outburst of gnoise, and moments later she ran back in, chasing a 
bantam. 
%The bantam raced around the kitchen clucking frantically, while 
the cook chased after it, swinging wildly with her cleaver] 
[5191:chased the bantam back outside. The clucking came to a 
sudden end and the cook returned with the bantam tossed over her 
shoulder] 
[5192:plucked the bantam] 
[5193:gutted the bantam and threw the giblets into the stewing 
pot in the fireplace. "There's your supper, Daisy," she laughed] 
[5194:stuffed the bantam with a large orange and put it into 
the oven with the bread] 
[5200:chopped up turnips, bananas and other odds and ends, and 
tossed them into the stewing pot in the fireplace] 
[5201:% %Daisy had a gniff of the stew and said, "Pooh! Master 
won't like that stuff!" 
%"He's gnot getting it," replied the cook, "It's for you"] 
[5202:stirred the stew slowly, holding her gnose] 
[5203:poked the fire and sent flames curling up the sides of the 
stewing pot] 
[5210:swept the bantam feathers up from the floor and wrapped 
them in an old gnewspaper] 
[5211:dumped a load of bantam feathers into the dustbin] 
[5220:suddenly smelled something burning and dashed across the 
kitchen to the oven. Black smoke gushed out as she opened the 
door. She groped into the oven and emerged with a tray of crisp, 
black buns. 
% 
%"Ah well," said the cook, throwing the bread onto the fire, 
"it'll save a trip to the coal cellar"] 
[5221:% %Daisy watched the bread burning in the fire and said to 
the cook, "You're right! You ought to go into the coal business"] 
[5222:opened the oven and took out the bantam. "Ah, this looks 
luvly," she said as she, putting it on the table. "I could almost 
eat it all myself. In fact, I will." And she did] 
[5223:finished off the bantam and washed it down with a gnice 
bottle of wine] 
; 
;* artist racetrack * 
[5230:said, "G'day to you, sport! Welcome to my home"] 
[5231:dabbed at a painting of a vase of sunflowers. "This is my 
Van Gogh", he said] 
[5232:%Daisy replied, "It looks more like the van door to me"] 
[5233:hummed a song about gneighbours. Ingrid felt a lump rise 
in her throat, but fortunately Rulf stopped in time] 
[5234:said, "And gnow for some modern art". He found an old 
bush hat, dangled its corks into a variety of paints, and shook 
his head vigorously] 
[5235:dipped a boomerang into a pot of red paint and threw it 
towards the canvas. "I haven't done this for a while," he 
commented, "but it's coming back to me gnow"] 
[5236:%Daisy spilled a tin of paint over a blank canvas. 
"Whoops! Clumsy me," she said. 
%"Brilliant work, sport!", complimented Rulf, "A perfect Andy 
Warhol"] 
[5237:began to sing while he worked, "Two little gnomes had two 
little homes.." 
%"Come on everybody, join in," he enthused] 
[5238:brought out some serviettes, folded like paper boats 
and stacked in a row] 
[5239:%Daisy sorted through the stack of canvasses and said, "I 
didn't know that Gnoma Lisa drank Rollo's scrumpy"] 
[5240:took a lump of red clay and threw it on the dusty floor. 
"And that's how to make a model of Hairs Rock!", he explained] 
[5241:opened his lunch box and munched some kangaroo sandwiches] 
[5242:hopped around the room, wild-eyed] 
[5243:signed a Constable forgery, "PC 49"] 
[5244:showed Ingrid a picture of a small shrub. "I call this 
one The Bush", he said] 
[5245:showed her a lithograph of paired doors marked "Ladies" 
and "Gents". "This is me Two-loos Lautrec", he explained] 
[5246:rub at a painting with Brillo pads. "Have it looking as 
good as old in gno time", he said]
