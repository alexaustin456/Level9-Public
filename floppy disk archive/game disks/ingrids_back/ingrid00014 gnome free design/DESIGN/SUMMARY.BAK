                          DESIGN OUTLINE 

"Gnome Free" was the first ever adventure told in flashback, as 
Aunt Ingrid Bottomlow recounted her adventures to the Tackhammer's 
oldest daughter. The child acted as an unseen observer, commenting 
on events and providing hints (e.g if Ingrid's story was not 
progressing, saying "Auntie, hurry up and tell me the bit when you 
dug a hole and found the key"). 

The game started with Ingrid's marriage to Jasper Quickbuck and 
ended, in the worst tradition of "A Woman of Substance" epics, with 
her the richest woman in the world. 

The cover featured a barred cell door, with Ingrid visible on the 
inner sleeve through the cut-out gaps between the bars on the outer 
sleeve. If the game went badly, it turned out that Ingrid was indeed 
in prison (e.g framed by Jasper) or, if went well, that she was 
in a barred vault counting her money, or that Jasper's plots had 
rebounded and she was just visiting him.

DIARY 

The diary started with the description of Ingrid's shotgun marriage 
to Jasper, and their wedding night when he drank the Micky Finn 
intended for her (she sent away the trolls who secretly entered, 
intending to dispose of her sleeping body). 

On-going themes included: 
* Occasional interjections from Miss Tackhammer, to whom Auntie 
  Ingrid is assher money, or that Jasper's plots had 
rebounded and she was just visiting him.

DIARY 

The diary started with the description of Ingrid's shotgun marriage 
to Jasper, and their wedding night when he drank the Micky Finn 
intended for her (she sent away the trolls who secretly entered, 
intending to dispose of her sleeping body). 

On-going themes included: 
* Occasional interjections from Miss Tackhammer, to whom Auntie 
  Ingrid is assgrid's relatives' subtle attempts to borrow money (she never 
  understood).  
* Her unappreciated attempts to provide modern facilities for the 
  village. 
* Jasper's attempts to bump off Ingrid, resulting in him drinking 
  the poison, being trapped in the basement until he dug himself 
  out, getting flattened by a large weight, tattered by dogs etc.. 

When Jasper, bruised and battered, fled abroad (to the least 
hospitable men-only place imaginable), Ingrid put a stop to the 
last of his money-making fiddles. Unfortunately this reduced the 
estate's income to nil, but Ingrid was not dismayed. 

She determined to make a fortune honestly.. 


PART 1: SMALL BUSINESSWOMAN 

The natural resources of the Dribble Valley were few, but possible 
products included Great Aunt Halfyard's turnip elixir, Green Gnome 
floor cleaner and Granny Gnutson's Gnorsegnome Relics. 

Ingrid's experience mirrored Level 9's, plus tips from "The Lazy 
Man's Way to Riches", and she visited..
* Great Aunt Halfyard's basement (to find why the recipe wouldn't 
  work unless made there). 
* The home of the man who sells all those yuppie gadgets you get 
  advertised in colour supplements (pyramid ionizers, car vacuum 
  cleaners, golf ball embossers). It's furnished appropriately.  
* A company not unlike large software publishers. 

Ingrid had even worse problems than other businesswomen report with 
being taken seriously by men.

Ingrid wisely refused all the orders from large companies and 
accepted a small order for elixir from the yuppie mail-order firm.  

Having landed a trial order for several gallons of the potion, 
Ingrid asked Great Aunt Halfyard to work flat out.. One week later 
she returned, bearing a large churn which turned out to contain, 
protected by many layers of padding, about a teaspoon full. 

Ingrid used the yuppie toys to produce a jury-rigged production 
line and the potion was on stream. 


PART 2: WHOLLY WRITS

Ingrid's elixir was a sensation, but caused more than a few problems. 
By curing most ills and prolonging life, it risked causing great 
upheavals in society and putting a lot of people out of work. 

So the potential losers (trade unions, drugs companies, doctors etc) 
called in the authorities.. Did Ingrid's business have planning 
permission? Had her "drug" been properly tested? 

So the writs were served and the pickets and bureaucrats descended 
upon Little Moaning. 

Had Ingrid done nothing, her income would have been blocked for long 
enough to bancrupt her business and waste all her money so that she 
could not defend herself against charges of fraud. She would have 
ended in prison. 

Fortunately, Ingrid was able to delay them (by altering signposts 
and house names, Jumbo demolishing the bridge, locking people in 
the barn etc) until Great Aunt Halfyard managed to find the old 
deeds that she vaguely remembered, which gave special rights and 
autonomy to "whosoever liveth in ye parish of Dribblemouth".  


PART 3: GNOME OF ZURICH  

Having made her first fortune, Ingrid enlarged it enormously in the 
City by take-overs and subtle share dealing. 

Then, at the very end of the game, Jasper reappeared with a plan to 
frame Ingrid and thereby gain control of her immense wealth. But she 
succeeded in having the perfect alibi (by being in prison herself 
at the time of the crime) and Jasper was locked away instead. 
 
Thus Ingrid Bottomlow became the richest gnome in the world.
