Cover picture:
 
 "Gnome Free" uses Level 9's new box design. This has an inner 
 sleeve open at the top (like a rectangular box with its shortest 
 side missing), which slides into an outer sleeve open at the long 
 edge. The box takes an A5 booklet, so the front has therefore 
 much the same proportions as A5, but is just slightly bigger. 

 The outer sleeve had a cell door, with Ingrid's hands resting, 
 Chad-like, on the sill of its barred window. The cardboard 
 between the bars is cut out, so that you can look through and 
 see Ingrid's head and shoulders from the inner sleeve beneath. 

 The inner sleeve has a picture of Ingrid, dressed like an old-time 
 film-star, in furs, standing in her treasure vault. (But there's 
 little or no treasure around the part of Ingrid visible from the 
 outside, so she looks like a prisoner when the box is closed.) 

 The side walls of the treasure vault are unimportant, but Ingrid 
 should be surrounded by such things as: gold pieces all over the 
 floor (perhaps pouring from a sack she holds), gold bars in a 
 criss-cross stack, a huge safe, sheaves of rolled up bonds, a 
 matched pair of security cameras etc. Seating (?) her on a throne 
 might be nice (but make the back big enough that only its plain 
 centre is visible behind her head). 

 Godfrey, please just do the inner picture for now. The outer one 
 will be pretty           GNOME FREE PICTURES. COPYRIGHT (C) 1988 LEVEL 9
