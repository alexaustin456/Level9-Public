Dear Graham, 

            I've just finished the first pass through the text of 
Gnome II and have the following comments, which I'd like borne in 
mind when the next game is done.. 

1) Please ensure that all messages are present for long room 
   descriptions and first-time-in-room messages. Blank messages 
   should be present but commented out, e.g:   ;; [1375:] ; etc..

2) Please comment all long room descriptions, first-time messages, 
   examine messages etc so we know what they refer to. e.g: 
   [1143: in the Dunes. Etc..] ; back of Dunrollin 

3) Location exits must all be apparent, without using the EXITS 
   command. E.g: Ingrid could be north of a door (south), at the 
   top of a hill (down), at a cross-roads (if following a north- 
   south road, this would give us N,S,E,W). Or, if we know how 
   Ingrid must have reached a location for the first time, she 
   could see hear on her right, watch someone cross the road, 
   see a hand wave from the window above etc.. 

4) First-time-in-room messages are underused. Generally speaking, 
   jokey room descriptions should go here (they get rapidly less 
   funny if read more than once), and there should a lot of 
   story-telling (and exit-suggesting) messages. The easiest 
   people to code are those you meet in passing.
