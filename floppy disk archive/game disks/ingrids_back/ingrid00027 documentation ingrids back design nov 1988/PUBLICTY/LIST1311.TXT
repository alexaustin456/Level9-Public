Dear Sir, 

               "Ingrid's Back!" was very well received on 16-bit, 
(C&VG ended with "Go out and buy a copy!") and gnow the 8-bit 
versions of Level 9's latest comedy adventure are ready. 

I enclose a Commodore 64 disk version. 

Here's some text prepared with the help of a PR agency (just be 
thankful I didn't send you their original!)... 


                  GNOME GNEWS IS GOOD GNEWS 

Latest gnews from the Level 9 camp is the Bottomlowdown on Ingrid. 
Having tamed the wilderness in "Gnome Ranger", the original Miss 
Adventure returns home to Little Moaning.. 

"Ingrid's Back!" is the sequel to Gnome Ranger and stars the gnomes 
of Little Moaning. Their happy life of fishing, sitting out in the 
rain and drinking gnome-brew, seems doomed by Jasper Quickbuck's 
plans to steam-roller the gnome-belt for yuppie housing. 

Can stunning Ingrid Bottomlow, she whose face could stop a thousand 
clocks, save the Gnome counties? Or is she a gnome of lost causes?  

Either way, with accident-prone Ingrid on the warpath, it's going 
to be fun! 
               *******************************

The main technical innovation is that "Ingrid's Back!" is the first 
game to use the full power of Level 9's unique "racetracks", for 
the most lifelike gnomes ever. 

                The full list of versions is..
       Amiga, ST, PC, Mac ........................... #19.95 
       CPC/PCW/+3 triple-format disc ................ #19.95 
       8-bit discs: Atari XL/XE, C64, Apple II ...... #14.95 
       Tapes: CPC, Atari XL/XE, C64, MSX, Spectrum .. #14.95 

The two Commodore 64 versions both cost #14.95. The main difference 
is that the disk version has about 30 pictures, whereas the tape 
version is text-only but has a bit more text (we don't gneed a 
graphics screen in memory and use the space for more game data).
