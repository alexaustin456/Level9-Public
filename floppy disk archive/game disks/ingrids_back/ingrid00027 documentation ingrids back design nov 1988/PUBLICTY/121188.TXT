Dear Harald, 

            All the "Ingrid's Back!" versions are now finished and 
the first reviews appearing. 

They are very good (see enclosed photocopies) so, as you can see 
on the Commodore 64 disc game enclosed, we have added a triangular 
sticker to the box, with review highlights. 

Please let me know your current plans. 


                        Best wishes, 


                                    Pete Austin 


PS: Level 9's IBM system now supports VGA slightly better, using a 
    wider palette than for EGA. It can also cope with mCGA (which 
    I believe is a new PS/2 standard). These changes will benefit 
    future games, though we do not plan to remaster the current IBM 
    versions of our games for the UK.
