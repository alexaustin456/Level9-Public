        Commodore 64 disc "Ingrid's Back!" rrp #14.95 
        Atari 8-bit disc  "Ingrid's Back!" rrp #14.95 
                  Will reach you Wednesday 16/11/88

Please order today, or Tuesday, if you want to be sure of getting 
supplies in the first day. 



I have always been convinced that good review quotes on the box 
help sell games, so we have added a triangular red sticker to the 
top corner of the box. Its text is: 

                                 / \    
                               /ZZAP \

            +-------------------------------------------+ 

(The real one looks very good, but is on a coloured background and 
wouldn't fax well). We will send a batch of stickers with the next 
order, in case you have stock that you would like to label.
