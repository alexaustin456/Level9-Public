Dear Pamela, 

            The IBM/Amstrad PC version of "INGRID'S BACK!" is 
ready and should really be ordered today, if you want it for the 
launch tomorrow. 

PC "INGRID'S BACK" includes both 3.5" and 5.25" discs (both the 
common disc formats), works on every clone that we tried at the 
recent PC show (from Spectrum 200 to PS/2), and has graphics on 
all common display formats (EGA,VGA,CGA,Hercules). 

Packaging is in shrink-wrapped Rainbird/Acornsoft-sized boxes, and 
the title is on every face so it can be displayed any way round. 

                     The R.R.P is #19.95. 

"INGRID'S BACK" is receiving consistently good reviews, including 
the attached one from C&VG which concludes "Go out and buy it!" 

                         Yours faithfully, 


                                          Pete Austin 


PS: The number for orders is at Level 9's Weston-super-Mare office: 
    (0934) 814450, though you are welcome to 'phone Bracknell too.
