Dear Godfrey, 

             Thanks for the revised picture, which is a very great 
improvement. Ingrid is now recognisable, though still not quite right. 

To be specific, Ingrid needs:
* a slight lowering of her hairline in the middle (a bit like a 
  rounded "widow's peak", about 1/2 cm lower in the middle), 
* wider pupils in her eyes (perhaps 50% wider), and more pronounced 
  white highlights to give her eyes a sparkle, 
* wider teeth and narrower gaps between them,
* the corners of her mouth pulled back into a smile. This might 
  involve, e.g, extending the near side by perhaps 1/2 cm, into a 
  deep dimple at the corner. This would automatically make her cheeks 
  more rounded, 
* her legs (which now nicely uneven) should be less fat towards the 
  top; keep her ankles the same width, but reduce the width at the 
  top of her legs to 3.5 cm. 

I hope that these changes are minor, and look forward to seeing the 
completed picture. 

After this, we'll want a picture entitled "Lady Gnome", showing how 
Ingrid looks after marrying Jasper Quickbuck and becoming exceedingly 
rich. However, I'll wait to get this one finished before giving you 
the details. 


                      Best wishes, 


                                  Pete Austin
