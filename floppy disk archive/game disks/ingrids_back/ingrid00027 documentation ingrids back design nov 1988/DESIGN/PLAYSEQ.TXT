    INGRID'S BACK! PLAY SEQUENCE. COPYRIGHT (C) 1988 LEVEL 9
    --------------------------------------------------------

The following list of commands takes you through all three parts 
of Ingrid's Back, solving the puzzles as intended and completing 
the game fairly quickly. You should also try the system features: 
SAVE/RESTORE, RAM SAVE/RESTORE, UNDO, WORDS, PICTURES, editor etc. 

Because the gnomes move about quite a bit, you may find one of 
them gone when the time comes for them to help Ingrid. Just try 
something like "FIND JUMBO", "FOLLOW FLOPSY" or "WAIT FOR GNORA" 
and continue when Ingrid has found them again. 

In the commands, "|" means "Enter or Return".
