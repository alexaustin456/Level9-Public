Dear Mr. San,

             I am writing to thank you for putting your STERM 
package into the public domain market.  It has been very useful to 
me  in  porting our programs onto the ST.  A cheque  is  enclosed.

     Do  you  know if anyone in this country is running  a  public 
domain  software library for CPM68K / ST yet?  (or indeed if there 
is any PD/freeware software available).

     Let me know if you produce any other utilities which might be 
of use in writing assembler programs or word processing etc.

     Many Thanks.



               Yours Sincerely,












                              Mike Austin.
