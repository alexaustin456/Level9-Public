Hi! 

Just a short word of welcome from Level 9, creators of Gnome Ranger. We
hope you like Ingrid as much as we do.

If you discover any oddities or bugs (perish the thought!); or if you have 
some suggestions or ideas for improvements, please write to us at the 
address below so that future ST games can be even better.

HELP! If you are stuck, the packaging includes instructions for contacting 
us to get a clue sheet. Please enclose the inlay card (cover) as proof of 
purchase, a self-addressed envelope and a stamp (or an international 
reply coupon) for our reply. Be sure you say you have the ST version 
of Gnome Ranger.

ST FEATURES. In addition to its advanced game facilities (eg FOLLOW person,
GOTO place or object, WAIT for person, and the ability to give people like 
the Gnymph complex orders to carry out while you get on with playing the
game), ST Gnome Ranger provides: 
 pictures on colour and black-and-white monitors;
 picture cache (avoiding ungnecessary disk loads); 
 previous command recall and editing, by cursor keys and DELETE;
 SAVE/RESTORE (save position on a disk of your choice);
 RAM SAVE/RESTORE (save your position in memory);
 OOPS (take back move. Most STs permit many OOPSes in succession). 

Stop command. If you want someone to stop carrying out an order, perhaps 
because circumstances have changed, just type e.g. EAGLE, STOP 

HARD DISKS AND DOUBLE SIDED DRIVES. Gnome Ranger is supplied on floppy disk, 
but we are pretty confident that it should work on other disk drives too.
(No promises! This is a free extra feature, so it's gnot a bug if the game 
won't work on your peculiar disk drive.) Level 9 have tested the game on 
single- and double-sided floppies and on our Winchester. Just copy the 
disk, file by file, into a folder of your choice, and run it by clicking 
on GAME.PRG

Demonstration Game. If you would like a continuous demonstration of the
game, perhaps for use in a shop, run the game and WAIT FOR THE FIRST
PICTURE TO FINISH LOADING (i.e. the boarder and road) and the game
is waiting for a command. Then press Alternate R

Please remember that Gnome Ranger is protected by copyright and took a lot 
of gnome-years to produce, so only make one copy, for your own use, to
keep only as long as you have the original game.

EXTRA PICTURES. Gnome Ranger is supplied on a dual format disk. This means
that it will work on both single sided and double sided drives. However,
on a single sided disk, you will only see about a dozen of the pictures.
If you do gnot have a double sided disk drive, but would like more
pictures, we can supply a (single-sided) picture disk from which the game
can load them. Write to say that you want an ST picture disk for Gnome 
Ranger, enclosing a stamped self-addressed envelope, with 2 pounds in the 
form of a sterling cheque drawn on a UK bank.

DESK ACCESSORIES. Gnome Ranger tries to grab as much memory as possible,
for picture cache and oops buffers etc. And it maintains a split-screen.
While the game seems OK with most desk accessories, we feel that having
them in memory is asking for trouble. Please either boot Gnome Ranger 
directly, or start the ST with a boot disk that does gnot load 
ungnecessary desk accessories.

Happy Adventuring!

            Pete, Mike, Nick, John, Leon and Ingrid.
