  _Lancelot master for the Commodore Amiga_
  
  The master for the  Amiga  version  of Lancelot is supplied on an ordinary
  Amiga disk. The disc is not protected.
  
  To run Lancelot switch on  the  machine  and  insert  kickstart  (on  some
  machines  this  is not necessary). When asked to insert "Workbench" insert
  the game disk.
  
  To copy the  disk boot the machine with "Workbench" then use the Workbench
  pull-down menu options to Initialise a new master disk, then copy the disk
  by dragging the source disc icon over the destination disc icon.
  
  
  
                                                        23rd September 1988.
  
  _Lancelot disc master for the APPLE II_
  
  The  master  for  the   APPLe  II   version  of Lancelot is supplied on an
  ordinary  Apple  disc  in  non-standard format (i.e.  The  disc  will  not
  CATALOG)
  
  To run Lancelot boot the  disc  i.e.  switch  on  the  Apple  then put the
  Lancelot disc in the drive
  
  To copy the disc use  either  the program COPY or ACOPY found on the Apple
  DOS system disc.

  _Lancelot disc master for the Atari XL/XE_
  
  The  master  for  the  Atari  XL/Se  version  of Lancelot is supplied on a
  double-density  disc. The disc is formatted by the  Atari  1050  drive  in
  double-density  mode. 
  
  To run  Lancelot, switch off  the  Atari  for at least 10 seconds to clear
  its memory. Then hold down the 'Option' key  and  switch  on.  Insert  the 
  Lancelot disc.
  
  The disc is formatted to  double density by an Atari 1050 drive, the first
  1040 blocks of the disc are  used  to  store  the  boot  tracks, a 'dummy'
  directory, and the code and data used for  Lancelot. The 'dummy' directory
  defeats  the DOS 'Duplicate' command and also any file-by-file copiers. To
  produce copies of Lancelot use a block-by-block copier. None of the blocks
  on the disc are protected.

                                                       13th. September 1988.
  
  _Lancelot master for the Atari XL/XE tape_
  
  The  master  for  the Atari XL/XE version of Lancelot is supplied on three
  normal single-density Atari XL/Xe  discs.  These   instructions   use   an
  Atari  XL/Xe  with both datacorder and disc drive to produce a tape master
  ready for duplication. Some duplicators  are  able to connect high-quality
  tape recorders to an Atari XL/XE, so this method allows high-quality tapes
  to be produced.
  
  The master disc  is  not  protected and the DOS 'D'uplicate command can be
  used to copy the disc for security.
  
  To run the  master  tape  on  an  Atari XL/XE switch on while holding down
  OPTION and START keys. Start the tape on  play and press RETURN. Note that
  some  Atari's  are  able  to  hold  their   memory   contents    for  some
  time  even  when switched-off, so if the Atari has previously been running
  DOS it may  be  necessary  to  switch  off for up to 30 seconds to get the
  Atari to correctly boot from tape.
  
  *page

  _Duplication_
  
  Lancelot is a three-part game, supplied on three discs. The three parts of
  Lancelot are mastered  in exactly the same way, using a different disc for
  each part. Underlining is used for the keys you have to press.
  
  1. Switch off the Atari,  remove  all cartidges, switch on the disk drive,
     choose the disk for the part of Lancelot to be mastered and put this in
     the drive, hold down OPTION and then switch on  again.  After approx 20
     seconds the DOS menu appears.
  
  2. To master the tape, load and run the three machine-code programs:
     SAVE1, SAVE2, SAVE3  and  SAVE4  in  that  order. Each program requires
     RETURN to be  pressed  once  or twice (to initiate saving to tape) then
     when saving finishes each program returns to the DOS menu. This process
     is summarised below:
  
         _L_ _SAVE1_ _Y_ _Y_              (Loads for 40 seconds)
         press RETURN twice       (Saves for 90 seconds)
         _L_ _SAVE2_ _Y_ _Y_              (Loads for 45 seconds)
         press RETURN.            (Saves for 35 seconds)
         _L_ _SAVE3_ _Y_ _Y_              (Loads for 55 seconds)
         press RETURN.            (Saves for 4 mins)
         _L_ _SAVE4_ _Y_ _Y_              (Loads for 45 seconds)
         press RETURN.            (Saves for 11 mins)
  
  3. Testing.
     When saving is complete switch off the Atari for  30  seconds  (to exit
     DOS and clear memory), then load the master tape  (described  above) to
     test than the master has been produced correctly. Each part when loaded
     displays about a screen-full of text.

  _Lancelot master for the Commodore 64 disk_
  
  The  master  for  the  Commodore 64 version of Lancelot is supplied on two  
  ordinary   single-sided   discs.   Neither   disc    is   protected.   The
  duplicated masters should be "flippy  discs",  side  1 should be the "game
  disc" and side 2 the "picture disc". The game disc contains a turbo-loader
  which contains copyrighted code.
  
  To run Lancelot on a Commodore 64 type insert the "game disc":
      _LOAD "*",8,1_
  
  To run Lancelot on a Commodore 128:
      Switch on the machine with the Commodore-symbol key held down.
      Insert the "game disc"
      Type the command _LOAD "*",8,1_
  
  There are a large number of public domain  disc  copiers for the Commodore
  64/128,  any of which will copy Lancelot. The disc can  be  copied  either
  file-by-file or by using a disc-block copier.

  _Lancelot Master for the Commodore 64 tape_
  
  The  master  for  the  Commodore  64  version of Lancelot is supplied on a
  normal single-sided CBM 64 disc. These instructions  use  a  Commodore  64
  with  both  datacorder  and  disc  drive  (or  CBM 128 with datacorder) to
  produce a tape master ready for duplication. Some  duplicators are able to
  connect  high-quality tape recorders to a CBM 64, so  this  method  allows
  high-quality tapes to be produced.
  
  The  master disc is not protected and any disc copy utility can be used to
  copy the disc. The disc contains a tape turbo-loader which is copyright of
  "Choice Software".  The  final  master  tape  however is only copyright of
  Level 9 Computing.
  
  Turbo-loaders other than the  'Choice'  turbo  may  be used with Lancelot.
  Details are given later.
  
  To run the master tape on a Commodore  64  just  after switch-on hold down
  SHIFT and press RUN/STOP.
  
  To run the master tape on a Commodore 128 enter '64'  mode, then hold down
  SHIFT and press RUN/STOP.

*page


  _Duplication_
  
  These instructions will assume that  the  'choice'  turbo-loader  is being
  used to produce the master tape.
  
  The three  parts  of  Lancelot  are mastered in exactly the same way. Only
  filenames differ. Underlining is used for the keys you have to press.
  
  1. Load the turbo-loader:
         _LOAD "!",8,1_
     Once loaded the turbo-loader menu appears.
  
  2. Select  the baud  rate with option _8_ then press _2_  (speed  is  7  times
     normal)
  
  3. Save the turbo-header using option _1_
         for the first  part use the filename _LANCELOT 1_
         for the second part use the filename _LANCELOT 2_
         for the last   part use the filename _LANCELOT 3_
  
  4. Select 'Load program part' _2_ and load file _GAMEA_
  
  5. Select 'Save program part' _3_ without relocation _N_
  
  6. Select 'Load program part' _2_
         for the first  part load the file _GAME1_
         for the second part load the file _GAME2_
         for the last   part load the file _GAME3_
  
  7. Select 'Save program part' _3_ without relocation _N_
  
  8. Select 'Load program part' _2_ and load file _GAMEB_
  
  9. Select 'Save last program part' _4_ to save machine-code _M_
     Use an execute-address of _4867_ and relocate _Y_ to address _57344_
  
  _Testing_
  
  When saving is complete switch off the Commodore (to exit the turbo-loader
  and clear memory),  then  load  the  master tape (described above) to test
  than  the  master  has  been produced correctly.  Each  part  when  loaded
  displays about a screen-full of text. 

*page

  _Other turbo loaders_
  
  The 'choice'  turbo loader defaults file start- and end-addresses to those
  stored in the  file-header  on   disc.   Not  all turbo's do this, so this
  information is duplicated below:
  
  _Filename_       _Start address_     _Length_
  
    GAMEA           1300            0540
  
    GAME1           1840            B7C0
    GAME2           1840            B7C0
    GAME3           1840            B7C0
  
    GAMEB           E000            1700
  
  Also on the disc is the file "TITLE MPIC" which is the loading screen used
  on the disc version of CBM 64 Lancelot. This is stored in "CBM 64 Advanced
  OCP Art Studio" format, and should  be  displayed during loading from tape
  only if the turbo-loader used allows this; Otherwise  this  file should be
  ignored.

  _Lancelot Master for the Amstrad CPC 464/6128 tape_
  
  The  master  for  the  Amstrad  CPC 464/6128 tape version of  Lancelot  is
  supplied on a normal single-sided CPC   disc.   These  instructions use an
  Amstrad with both tape recorder and disc drive   to  produce a tape master
  ready  for  duplication. Some duplicators are able to connect high-quality
  tape recorders to  a  CPC,  so this method allows high-quality tapes to be
  produced.
  
  The  master  disc  is  not  protected and the CP/M utility _disccopy_ can be
  used to copy the disc for security.
  
  To run the master on an Amstrad CPC464 type _RUN ""_ and play the tape.
  
  To run the master on an Amstrad CPC6128 type _|TAPE_ then _RUN""_.

  _Lancelot for the IBM PC and PC compatibles_
  
  The  master  for  the  PC  version  of Lancelot is supplied on an ordinary
  double-sided 40-track 5 1/4" PC disc. The disc is not protected.
  
  To  run  Lancelot  boot  your  PC  with  MS-DOS version 2 or 3. Insert the
  Lancelot disk. If you booted from a hard  disc  select the floppy with _A:_.
  Type _MENU_
  
  To copy the disk use  the  program  _diskcopy_  on  the PC system disk. On a
  machine with one floppy drive type:
     _diskcopy a: a:_

  _Lancelot disc master for the MAC_
  
  The  master  for  the   APPLe  MAC  version  of Lancelot is supplied on an
  ordinary single-sided disc. 
  
  To run  Lancelot,  boot the MAC  system, then insert the Lancelot disc and
  click on the application-icon "Lancelot". When  running under Multi-Finder
  do not try to run any other programs at the same time.
  
  The disc has to be single-sided to  be  readable  by early versions of the
  MAC.  The  MAC  cannot  produce  sector-by-sector  copies of discs, so the
  following is the recomended method for producing  identical  copies of the
  Lancelot disc on a single-drive system:
  
  1) Insert a blank disc  and  when  requested  (the  MAC says "This disk is
     unreadable"),  format  it  one-sided  and   leave   the   disk-name  as
     "Untitled". If the disc is  already formated when its disc-icon appears
     click on that, then select "Erase disc" from the pull-down menu.
  
  2) Once  initialised, type alt-E, to eject the disc. (alt is the key  with
     four-circles). Insert the Lancelot master.
  
  3) Drag the "Lancelot" disc-icon over the "Untitled"  disc-icon,  MAC  the
     confirms with "Are you sure you want to completely replace the contents
     of...". click on 'OK'.
  
  4) Once the copy is   complete, use the grabber-bar of the "Untitled" disk
     window to move its window to exactly cover the "Lancelot" window.
  
  5) Drag the  "Lancelot"  disk-icon  to the  Wastebasket  (this  closes its
     window).
  
  6) Click on the "Untitled" disk-icon and rename it (Just type the new name
     followed by ENTER) as "Lancelot".
  
  7) Type alt-E to eject the disc, then write-protect it.

  _Lancelot master for the MSX_
  
  The  master for the MSX version of Lancelot is supplied on four cassettes.
  These instructions  use a  MSX with tape recorder to produce a tape master
  ready for duplication.  Some  duplicators are able to connect high-quality
  tape recorders to a MSX,  so  this  method allows high-quality tapes to be
  produced.
  
  Some of the files on the  tape  are  recorded in Level 9's own format, and
  can only be read (and written) by the other programs on the tapes.
  
  To run the master on the MSX enter the command _RUN "CAS:"_
  
*page

  _Duplication_
  
  Lancelot  is  a  three-part  game.  There are only  minor  differences  in
  mastering  each part, so these instructions  need  to  be  repeated  three
  times, with  differences only where indicated. Underlining is used for the
  keys you have to press.
  
  1. Switch off the MSX, wait a few seconds then switch on again.
  
  2. Load the Basic title page, from the "PART 1" tape.
         _LOAD "CAS:"_
     Stop the tape as soon as it has loaded, but  do not rewind it. A second
     file is stored on the tape immediately following the Basic program.
  
  3. The MSX LOAD command does not check for load errors,  so  _RUN_ the title
  program  to  check  for  errors.  When  it  stops hold down _CTRL_ and press
  _STOP_ (Gives "Device I/O error in 80)
  
  4. Save the title to the master tape:
         For the first  part of Lancelot _SAVE "CAMELO"_
         For the second part of Lancelot _SAVE "LOGRIS"_
         For the last   part of Lancelot _SAVE "GRAIL"_
  
  5. Load the machine  code  program,  stored  on  TAPe  1  after  the basic
     program.
         _CLEAR 0,&H9000_
         _BLOAD "CAS:"_
     Once the program has loaded rewind tape 1.
  
  6. Save the machine-code
         _BSAVE "code",&HD180,&HF200,&HEA06_
     After saving finishes leave 10 seconds of blank tape.
  
  *page

  7. With the code from step 5 still in memory run the 'copy' program
         _DEF USR 0 = &HE000_
         _PRINT USR(0)_
  
     This also displays a checksum for the code loaded in  step 5 which must
     be 55218. Any  other  value indicates a loading error, which also means
     step 6 may have saved  corrupted code, so start again from the start of
     the current part of the Time and Magik game.
  
     For the first  part of Lancelot play tape 2
     For the second part of Lancelot play tape 3
     For the last   part of Lancelot play tape 4.
   
     These tapes take about 15 minutes to load.
  
  8. If the  data  loads OK it displays "Save file (Y/N)? "; Press _Y_ to save
     the game. If a loading  error  occurs  it  displays "Read error"; Press
     SPACE, rewind the tape and play it again.
  
  9. Test the new master. Switch off the MSX to exit the copy program and to
     clear  the MSX memory, wait a few seconds then switch on again. Run the
     game using _RUN "CAS:"_.
     Each part when loaded displays about a screen-full of text.

  _Lancelot Master for the Amstrad CPC/PCW/+3 Disc_
  
  The master for the CPC/PCW/+3  version of Lancelot is supplied on a single
  double-sided 3 inch disc. The disc  in  not protected, but is formatted by
  the CPC in 'DATA' format to make it  a tripple-format disc, read/writeable
  by the CPC 6128, PCW 8256, PCW 8512, PCW 9512 and Sinclair +3.
  
  To run Lancelot on the PCW 8256/8512/9512, boot from the system disc, then
  insert the 'game' side of Lancelot and type _MENU_
  
  To run Lancelot on the CPC6128 turn on the CPC,  insert  the  'game'
  side of the disc and type _RUN "MENU"_
  
  To run Lancelot on the Sinclair 128k +3 switch  on,  insert  the  disc and
  press ENTER.
  
  To  copy  the  disc insert side 1 of the  CPC  system  disc,   type   _|CPM_  
  then run  _disccopy_ on  the  same  disc.  Follow  the  prompts given by the
  program, which both formats and copies discs. Do not use either the PCW or
  +3 to format discs, as they cannot produce tripple-formatted discs.

  _Lancelot master for the Spectrum +2_
  
  These instructions are copyright (C) 1988 Level 9 Computing.
  
  The Spectrum +2 version of lancelot runs from  tape,  text-only, on all ZX
  Spectrums with 128K memory.
  
  The master for the Spectrum +2 version of Lancelot  is  supplied  on  four
  cassettes (labelled ZX +2). These instructions use a Spectrum 48 with tape
  recorder,  or  Spectrum +2 in 48 mode to  produce  a tape master ready for
  duplication. A Spectrum  +2  or  Spectrum +3 is needed to test the master.
  Some duplicators are able to connect  high-quality  tape  recorders  to  a
  Spectrum, so this method allows high-quality tapes to be produced.
  
  The game must be MASTERED in 48K mode, and will only run in 128K mode.
  
  Some  of  the  files on the tape are recorded in Level 9's own format, and
  can only be read (and written) by the other programs on the tapes.
  
  To run the master on a Spectrum +2 select 'tape loader' and play the tape.
  
  To run the master on a Spectrum +3  select 'loader' and play the tape. (An
  adaptor lead is required to connect the SOUND socket to a tape recorder.)
  
  *page

  _Duplication_
  
  Lancelot is  a  three-part  game.  There  are  only  minor  differences in
  mastering  each  part,  so  these  instructions  need to be repeated three
  times, with differences only where indicated. Underlining  is used for the
  keys you have to press.
  
  You might like to know the keystokes for the following keywords:
  
       LINe          extend symbol-shift 3
       CODe          extend I
       USR           extend L
  
  On  some  keyboards  extend-mode is entered  by  pressing  CAPS-SHIFT  and
  SYMBOL-SHIFT together.
  
  1.  Switch off the  Spectrum, wait a few seconds then switch on again. On a
      128K machine select 48 mode.
  
  2.  Load the Basic title page, from the "ZX +2 part 1" tape.
          _LOAD ""_
      Stop the tape as soon as it has loaded as there are three files on this
      tape.
  
  3.  Save it to the master tape:
          For the first  part of Lancelot _SAVE "LANCELOT 1" LINE 1_
          For the second part of Lancelot _SAVE "LANCELOT 2" LINE 1_
          For the last   part of Lancelot _SAVE "LANCELOT 3" LINE 1_
  
  4.  Load the machine code copy/loader program, the second file on tape 1.
          _LOAD "" CODE_
  
  5.  For the second and third parts of Lancelot patch the loader:
          _POKE 64294,2_   for part 2
          _POKE 64294,3_   for part 3.
  
  6.  Save the patched loader program
          _SAVE "game" CODE 64256,800_
  
  7.  Execute the copy routine, also loaded in (4) above.
          _PRINT USR 64265_
      which loads the third file from tape 1. Once loaded rewind tape 1.
  
      The copy program uses the  save  I/O routines as used   on Lancelot ,so
      it will pause about every 20 lines  and  flash  the  cursor,  When this
      happens press SHIFT to make the copy program continue.

  _Lancelot master for the Spectrum 48_
  
  The  master  for  the  Spectrum 48 version of Lancelot is supplied on four
  cassettes. These instructions use a   Spectrum  48  with  tape recorder or
  Spectrum +2/+3 running  in  '48'   mode to produce a tape master ready for
  duplication.  Some  duplicators  are  able to  connect  high-quality  tape
  recorders to a Spectrum, so  this  method  allows high-quality tapes to be
  produced.
  
  Some of the files on the tape are recorded in Level  9's  own  format, and
  can only be read by the other programs on the tapes.
  
  To run the master on a Spectrum 48 enter the command _LOAD ""_
  
  To run the master on a Spectrum +2/+3 enter '48' mode and enter _LOAD ""_

  _Duplication_
  
  Lancelot  is  a three-part game.  There  are  only  minor  differences  in
  mastering each part,  so  these  instructions  need  to  be repeated three
  times, with differences only where indicated. Underlining is used  for the
  keys you have to press.
  
  You  might  like  to know the keystokes for the following keywords when in
  48k mode: (On some  keyboards 'extend' is CAPS SHIFT and SYMBOL SHIFT held
  down together.)
  
       LINe          extend symbol-shift 3
       CODe          extend I
       USR           extend L
  
  1. Switch off the Spectrum, wait a few seconds then switch on again.
  
  2. Load the Basic title page, from the PART 1 tape.
         _LOAD ""_
     Once loaded stop the tape, there are three more files  following  it on
     the same tape, which are read by steps 4,6 and 10.
  
  3. Save it to the master tape:
         For the first  part of Lancelot _SAVE "LANCELOT 1" LINE 1_
         For the second part of Lancelot _SAVE "LANCELOT 2" LINE 1_
         For the last   part of Lancelot _SAVE "LANCELOT 3" LINE 1_
  
  4. Load the 'driver', the next file from the PART 1 tape.
         _LOAD "" CODE_
     Once loaded stop the tape.
  
  5. Save the program 'driver'
        _SAVE "code1" CODE 63344,1677_
  
  6. Load the program 'load', the third file on the PART 1 tape.
        _LOAD "" CODE_
  
  7. The 'loader' is supplied ready for use with the first part  of Lancelot
     and does not need patching. For  the  second part of Lancelot patch the
     loader:
        _POKE 26979,2_
     For the last part of Lancelot patch the loader:
        _POKE 26979,3_
  
  8. Save the 'loader'
         _SAVE "code2" CODE 26944,200_

  *page
  
  9. Execute the copy program, which is contained as part of the 'loader'
         _PRINT USR 62592_
  
     The copy program makes use of the I/O routines found in Lancelot, so it
     will pause about every 16 lines and flash the cursor, When this happens
     press SHIFT to make the copy program continue.
  
  10. Select   option  _1_  (the program  displayes   '11')   and   load  the
      fourth file from the PART 1 tape. Once loaded rewind the tape.
  
  11. Press _Y_ to save to the master tape.
  
  12. For the first  part of Lancelot select the PART 2 tape.
      For the second part of Lancelot select the PART 3 tape.
      For the last   part of Lancelot select the PART 4 tape.
      Press _N_ then select option _2_ and load the tape.
  
  13. Press _Y_ to save to the master tape.
  
  _Testing_
  
  When saving is complete switch off the Spectrum (to exit the copy program
  and clear memory),  then  load  the  master tape (described above) to test
  that  the  master  has  been produced correctly.  Each  part  when  loaded
  displays about two-thirds of a screen of text.

  _Lancelot master for the Atari ST_
  
  The master for the Atari ST version of Lancelot is supplied on an ordinary
  single-sided, 80 track, 10 sector disc. The disc is not protected.
  
  To run Lancelot insert the disk in drive A: and press RESET.
  
  To copy the disk use  any disc copier which can copy single-sided 80-track
  10-sector  discs.  Alternatively  format a blank  disk  with  a  10-sector
  single-sided formatter then copy the disc file-by-file.
