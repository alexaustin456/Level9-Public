; Dummy Exits File for Hero
;
; EXIT.TXT, data for the game exits. The numeric values for the 
; directions is as follows:
;
;         1           up=9      in=11    cross=13   climb=14   jump=15
;      8     2        down=10
;         !
;    7  --+--  3
;         !
;      6     5   <- note that 4&5 are reversed. You cannot change this.
;         4
;
; Special notes for interface between static and synthesised rooms..
;
; There must be an in/out connection between the static and the 
; object number of the scenery object to which it connects.
;
; E.g If you have a location object "[480:^N castle]", then an exit 
; from room 15:  1001 12 180
; will set up an in/out connection to the room where object no. 180
; is situated. This allows the exit table to be changed easily.
