            ----------------------------------------- 

The game is played on a full screen display, with the hero moved 
by the joystick, buttons A and B using whatever are carried in his 
left and right hands, SELECT switching to a possessions screen and 
RESTART displaying the current 8 letter "position code" and giving 
the option to start anew. Other actions are initiated by walking 
over objects shown on the screen, or bumping into them. 

The action display is shown below (characters represent 4*8 pixels):

STATUS BAR. The bottom of the screen shows a left hand and a right 
hand, each cupping the object held. Armour class is indicated by a 
helmet and a number, health by a partly-filled bar, wealth a bag of 
gold and a number, and dungeon level by a dragon head and a number. 
In the middle is the head of the chosen character (wizard, warrior 
or jester), with a short name and a number for the hero's current 
current experience level (e.g 9.85 would show that he was 9th level 
and well on the way to 10th). 


SPRITE NUMBERS. We plan to move the player and three other sprites, 
presumably enemies. Plus a few missiles in flight (though we will 
only let people fire one "arrow" at once). 


SPRITES are typically 48*24 (player) or 48*16 (humanoid creatures), 
though e.g a thrust sword will extend further. This size means the 
player and two enemies can usually be along side without flicker 
(other baddies will try to keep clear and line up a missile attack).  
 
Humanoid sprites are displayed "Double Dragon" fashion - facing 
diagonally, even if the creature moves orthoganally. (This takes 
only 40% as much ROM as holding all eight views, and avoids the 
rather boring view from directly behind.) Animals, on the other 
hand, will simply be shown from the side - facing left or right. 

The player sprite shows the current armour and weapons. If the 
player has a shield in his left hand, a sword in his right hand and 
owns a helmet, this is what will be seen. (The sprite data is built 
up, identikit fashion, as the object screen is left). 

The aim is for people and monsters to look solid and realistic. 

We will, however, ignore such realism when it seems right to do so. 
When the player fires a bow, the animated sequence of him stringing 
and firing an arrow will not show the shield he may be carrying (it 
would look odd). 


SPRITES IN RAM. There seems enough RAM for 14 animation frames in 
each of the two directions. We would like to allow for two types of 
enemies on screen at once, so this might give us 6 frames for the 
player and 4 for each monster. This is not enough to do full 
animation, but fortunately we do not need to... When the player 
walks, for example, his head and upper body need not change - they 
just move sideways, with a one-or-two pixel dip at the low point of 
each stride - so, if his legs are replaced on a 5-frame cycle, this 
is the equivalent of only 2 whole frames. 

We will try to ensure that sprite data is ready before use. If a 
group of orcs are about to enter stage right, the program will try 
to pre-load appropriate sprite data. Likewise, if the player goes 
near a bean stalk, there should be a second or two to get the 
"climbing sequence" ready before it is needed. 

If creatures wade through water or vegetation, their legs need not 
be sho those rippling water and flickering 
flame effects that you either love or hate, but that are good for 
attracting attention on "auto-play" mode. 

Each backdrop is built up from a (relatively) limited selection of 
previously-drawn tiles, in the usual way when trying to decorate a 
lot of rooms with limited graphics data. But, in addition, we have 
quite clever compression routines which should allow us to insert 
a number of unique graphics without the cost being too great. 


BACKGROUND OBJEC those rippling water and flickering 
flame effects that you either love or hate, but that are good for 
attracting attention on "auto-play" mode. 

Each backdrop is built up from a (relatively) limited selection of 
previously-drawn tiles, in the usual way when trying to decorate a 
lot of rooms with limited graphics data. But, in addition, we have 
quite clever compression routines which should allow us to insert 
a number of unique graphics without the cost being too great. 


BACKGROUND OBJECTS. All the sprites are needed for creatures, so 
static objects are drawn onto the background. This includes the 
magic items, weapons and treasures that you can pick up. (If they 
are dropped again, the program tries to ensure that they "land" on 
a clear patch of floor, away from nearby scenery which might use a 
conflicting palette.)
 
Background graphics are also used for things like opening doors, 
growing beanstalks, and probably "thought bubbles" which give clues. 

When you walk over something to pick it up, nearby sprites are 
temporarily "switched off" and a black window opened by successively 
changing the background palettes to black. A large picture of the 
object is displayed in this window for long enough to recognise it. 


POSSESSIONS SCREEN. Press SELECT to toggle between the action 
display and the possessions screen. On this, the joystick moves an 
eye pointer among the objects you own - an enlarged view of the 
current object being seen at the top right. Press A or B to switch 
the current object with whatever is held in that hand. Or, if the 
eye is moved to an icon on the bottom line, press A or B to give, 
eat or drop whatever is in that hand. 

The possessions display is below (characters represent 8*16 pixels):

The status bar is the same as that on the action display. And the 
give eat and drop icons are possibly a head and shoulders picture 
of an anonymous person, an open mouth and an arrow pointing to the 
ground, respectively.
