DESIGN OUTLINE 


                           OBJECT ICONS

As we intend to avoid words where ever possible, it is necessary to 
use icons instead. Whenever an object is picked up or selected, an 
enlarged picture is displayed, with an icon representing its function 
on the label.

  Scroll: paper, rolled at ends 
  Wand: stick with prickly end 
  Weapon: picture of dagger/sword/bow 

Categories...

  Protection: circle with diagonal bar on the type (cf Ghostbusters) 
  Wall: repeated types, side-by-side
