            ------------------------------------------- 

GENERAL NOTES 

Aeon is limited in its number of sprites, and these are basically 
reserved for creatures and/or missiles. Obstacles therefore use 
background graphics and will normally be set in the floor or walls 
so that creatures will never have to pass behind them. 

There are two major exceptions. One is very small obstacles (e.g 
falling missiles). The second uses the fact that extra sprites can 
be made available on alternate frames - they will flicker but this 
does not matter for translucent foreground obstacles such as 
flames or jets of freezing air. 

USES OF OBSTACLES 

A major feature of Aeon is that objects interect wherever possible. 
It is not feasible to completely list such effects without the 
design becoming hopelessly unwieldy, but here are some examples. 

On fire levels, there will be gratings in the floor through which 
flames occasionally emerge. The idea is to work out the pattern 
involved and cross the gratings between bursts of fire, but if you 
leave things on the grating then the following might happen.. 
 Inflamable object (eg scroll, chest): burns, leaving any contents; 
 Fireball wand: recharged;  Food: cooked; Torch: lit; 
 Ice: melted, leaving any contents.

On water levels, rain drips down. It fills any bottle below, and 
can be used to water plants, or thrown as a weapon (if acid rain). 
Acid water corodes metal, destroying
things on the ground.
