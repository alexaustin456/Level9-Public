            AEON THINGS. COPYRIGHT (C) 1988. LEVEL 9 
            ---------------------------------------- 

CREATURES are displayed by means of big sprites (48 by 16 or 24), 
which means we can't show too many at once. Thus Aeon is a game 
with a few, fairly powerful opponents on screen, rather than 
swarms of fragile ones. 

Where possible, initially "sleeping" creatures can be displayed as 
background objects (e.g a statue which wakes and is replaced by a 
sprite only as you get close), but this is unusual. 

Similary, Aeon has a few very large creatures, such as the dragons 
at the end of each level. These "guardians" are built into their 
rooms and are only partially animated - e.g the body of a giant 
snake would be static on the background, but the head might move 
about and spit poison.

As they have to go on the floor, modifying the background, these 
objects use limited colours to avoid attribute clashes (probably 
monochrome). And as they have to be small (typically 8*8 or 8*16) 
to be in scale with the people, no attempt is made to distinguish 
between the objects of a type - e.g all potion bottles look alike. 

This does not matter because, when an object is picked up, or 
selected on the possessions screen, an enlarged picture is shown 
and this makes its its function clear. E.g a ring of sight has a 
gem like an eye, and a wand of lightning is shown with a jagged 
spark at the tip.
