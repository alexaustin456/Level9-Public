          Level 9's Graphics Structure Editor 
          ----------------------------------- 

This editor is not for drawing pictures, but to let you take 
Neochrome format graphics (eg from Art Studio) and combine them 
into space-efficient 3D rooms, animation sequences etc. 

It handles four types of objects (graphics data)... 

* Cell: a 16x16 pixel square, in 16 colours (with colour 0 meaning  
  transparent). This is the way in which real pixels are stored: 
  the other objects are basically collections of cells. 

* Raster: a rectangle of cells, any number of cells wide by any 
  number high. Any cell can be used anywhere within a raster, and 
  the same cell can be used many times (to saves space). 

* XZH object. These are built from any number of any of the four 
  types of objects, each at its own 3D position. 

  The co-ordinate system is: 

         ^  H        (H is the height above the "floor") 
         | 
         | 
         +----->  X  (X is the left/right position) 
          \ 
           \ 
            Z        (bigger Z means it's nearer to the viewer)

  XZH objects can be used for a picture on a wall (i.e slightly 
  in front of it), an animated bird in a gilded cage (i.e slightly 
  behind the bars), or a 3D room made up from dozens of objects. 

* Animation sequence. This is a list of animation instructions: 
  object (display any of the four types of objects), shift (move), 
  repeat next instruction, and fork (start another animation 
  sequence, to run simulteneously). These instructions are processed 
  one-at-a-time in order.  



























                             EDITING 
                             ------- 

The screen normally displays two windows, one at the top and one at 
the bottom, and each shows one object. 

To the right of each window is a column of status information 
for the corresponding object. For example: 

20        Object number. 
4110      Current item (only used when editing an XZH object). 
0  0  64  3D position (X Z H) of current item (ditto). 
xzh       Type of object. 
x 144     X position of cursor object. 
z 16      Z position of cursor object. 
h 64      H position of cursor object. 
4x0x0     X, H, "unused" sizes of current object, if raster. 
Scr0,0    How far window is scrolled (X,Y). Use for big XZH objects.  
OqfHR     Status display (capital=on, lower case=off): 
            O=raster offset (only affects preview mode),  
            Q=quick mode (set when editing very big XZH objects), 
            F=fast mode (do not use), 
            H=auto height mode (for placing rasters on XZH floor), 
            R=reflect. 

The cursor is a flashing dot, which you can move anywhere with the 
mouse. Normally, when it is in one window (half of the screen), a 
copy of the object from the other window follows it about and can 
be placed at its current position by pressing the left mouse button 
or space - this is the usual way of building objects. 

Only XZH objects have truly 3D cursor movement. For these, the mouse 
controls movement along the ground (changing X and Z). And, provided 
you're not in auto height mode (toggled on/off by "H"), you press 
keyboard "-" and "+" (with or without shift), or move the mouse with 
its right button pressed, to change the height H above the ground. 


                  DISPLAYING ANOTHER OBJECT 
                  ------------------------- 

To change which object is displayed in the current window.. 

7/9 Numeric keypad 7 or 9 display the previous or next object. This 
    is not intended for moving from object 1 to 500, but is ideal if 
    e.g animation frames of a person running are stored in adjacent 
    objects, because you can step through them for a quick check. 

.   Dot makes the editor ask you for a new object number. Type a 
    number, press return and the chosen object is displayed. 

1/3 Numeric keypad 1 or 3 display the previous or next object in the 
    other window. (The other window doesn't visibly alter, because 
    it is not being updated, but the object number and therefore the 
    object following the cursor are changed). This is useful if, e.g, 
    you are copying adjacent cells into a raster. 










                          WHAT ALL THE KEYS DO 
                          -------------------- 

A = Auto-import graphics after "I"
B 
C = select first animation object 
D = Delete current raster or animation item 
E
F = toggle Fast mode (refreshes less screen) 
G 
H = toggle auto Height mode 
I = Import neochrome screen 
J 
K 
L 
M = toggle Magnify window (disabled) 
N 
O = display Object in animation sequence 
P = select Preview mode (Esc leaves it) 
Q = toggle Quick mode (experts only) 
R = set size of new Raster / Repeat animation 
S = save screen in Neochrome file / Shift animation 
T = toggle map mode (not worth using) 

U, V, W, X, Y, Z = nothing 

- = slow animation in preview mode / decrease H in XZH 
+ = speed animation in preview mode / increase H in XZH 

Up arrow    = Increase height of raster 
Down arrow  = Decrease height of raster 
Left arrow  = Increase width of raster 
Right arrow = Decrease width of raster  

0 = toggle single window mode 
Esc = to start of current XZH / cancel input, preview etc. 
Tab = step on to next item of current raster 
Delete = Delete items in current raster or animation 

Space  = place object (acts as left mouse button) 
Return = toggle reflection 
Help   = help and status information 
Undo   = save everything 

left mouse  = place object 
right mouse = press and move mouse to adjust H in XZH object 


NUMERIC KEYPAD...

* toggle 4-pixel mode. 
- decrease Z size for raster objects (don't use) 
+ increase Z size for raster objects (don't use) 

7 current object -1.   8 scroll raster up.    9 current object +1 
4 scroll raster left.  5 centre scroll.       6 scroll raster right 
1 other object -1.     2 scroll raster down.  3 other object +1

. (dot) ask for object number and change to that object
