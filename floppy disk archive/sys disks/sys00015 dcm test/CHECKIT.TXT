05/12/89  Release 2.00

		The following describes changes to CheckIt
		      since the manual was printed.

General

A few issues of compatibility are discussed in this section.  Mostly,
this text is purely informational; CheckIt will automatically take any
action necessary to maintain compatibility with a particular PC.

    DISK NAMES

    CheckIt refers to the physical drives installed in your PC as "Drive 0,"
    "Drive 1," etc.  Since you may not be familiar with these names, CheckIt
    tries to determine the DOS names for these drives as well (i.e. A:, B:,
    etc.).  The line below shows an example of how both a floppy and hard
    disk would be represented on a typical system:

        Floppy Drive 0 (A:)             Hard Drive 0 (C:-D:)

    On rare occations, CheckIt may mis-identify the DOS names for the drive.
    Since CheckIt does not use DOS drive names, all functions will still
    work properly on the drive number being used.

    THE HIMEM PROGRAM

    On AT and 386 class PC's, the Microsoft program HIMEM allows access to
    an additional 64K of standard DOS memory (for a total of 704K).  The
    methods used to accomplish this make it unsafe for CheckIt to test
    protected mode (in the System Board test) or extended memory (in the
    Memory test).  CheckIt will automatically detect the presence of HIMEM
    and skip these tests.

    VIRTUAL 8086 MODE ON A '386

    A number of multitasking and EMS emulator programs use the special
    "Virtual 8086 Mode" feature of the 80386 processor.  In this mode, if
    a program tries to access extended memory, the machine will lock up.

    CheckIt looks for this and avoids the problem by not testing protected
    mode (in the System Board test) or extended memory (in the Memory test).

    COMPATIBILITY

    CheckIt runs on most PC compatibles, and will probably run on yours.
    Here is a partial list of the systems and equipement that this version
    of CheckIt has been tested on and is fully compatible with:

    PC Systems:
	Amstrad PC
	AST Premium 386/25
	AT&T PC 6300
	AT&T PC 6386 WGS
	Compaq Portable I
	Compaq Deskpro 286
	Compaq Deskpro 386/20
	CompuAdd Turbo 10
	CompuAdd 286/12
	CompuAdd 386/16
	Epson Equity I+
	Everex 386/33
        IBM PC/XT/AT
	IBM PS/2 Models 30, 50, 60, 70, and 80

    Co-processors and Accelerator Cards:
        Intel 8087/80287/80387 Math Co-processor
	Orchid Tiny Turbo 286

    Video Adapters:
        MDA:  IBM Monochrome Display Adapter
   Hercules:  Everex Evergraphics Plus
	CGA:  IBM Color Graphics Adapter
	EGA:  EGA 480
       MCGA:  IBM (PS/2 Model 30)

	      Compaq 16-bit VGA adapter (On Compaq Deskpro 286)
              IBM (PS/2 Model 50, 60, 70, and 80)
	      Video 7 Vega VGA adapter

    DOS Versions:
	AT&T DOS 2.11 and 3.10
        PC-DOS and MS-DOS 2.00 to 3.30
	Compaq DOS 2.00 to 3.31
	Epson DOS 3.20

    Miscellaneous
	Microsoft Mouse
	Logitech Mouse
	Kraft Premium III Joystick

    The following paragraph explains known problems with specific systems:

    CheckIt will not test protected mode (in the System Board test) or 
    extended memory (in the Memory test) on the AT&T PC 6300+ and HP Vectra PC.
    All other functions work normally.  CheckIt automatically determines if
    it is running on one of these machines and skips these tests.

    HERCULES COMPATIBILITY

    CheckIt will detect and support the Hercules Monochrome Graphics
    Adapter (HGA) only when the MSHERC.COM program (on Disk #2) has
    been loaded first.  To do this, insert Disk #2 and type "MSHERC"
    from the DOS A> prompt before running CheckIt.


The Tools Menu

    HARD DISK FORMATTER

    CheckIt will ONLY low-level format standard AT & 386 class PC hard disks
    (17 sectors per track).

    CAUTION:  NEVER USE THIS FUNCTION TO REFORMAT A SCSI OR ESDI DRIVE!!

    Since this procedure will DESTROY ALL DATA ON YOUR HARD DISK, it is 
    important that you read and understand all of Chapter 24 before trying
    to low level format your drive.

The Setup Menu

    RAM LAYOUT

    Defining a RAM board is probably the most difficult thing to do in
    CheckIt.  To help with this process, a few common board layouts are
    described below.

	NOTE:  Many 386 PC's have a special 32 bit card that holds
	memory.  In these cases, CheckIt's picture of the board will
	often look different from your memory board.  To find a bad
	chip, note the bank and chip number blinking on the RAM Locate
	screen and find the corresponding chip on your memory board.
	The physical location may be different but the bank and chip
	numbers are the same.
