*    Atari SMM804 Matrix Printer Driver Configuration Table
*
*    This file contains tables defining the code sequences
*    to be sent to the printer to perform various functions
*    and to access the characters from codes in the Atari
*    character set.
*
****************************************************************

*
* Name of printer
* ===============
*
Atari SMM 804


*
* Miscellaneous configurable variables
* ====================================
*
* 1: printer type, 0=dot matrix, 1=daisy wheel
*    Note if printer type is 0 the following 4 variables are never used.
* 2: unit width of one character
* 3: unit height of one line
* 4: Approximate middle of carriage after formfeed
* 5: Carriage shift for bold overstrike
*
0, 0, 0, 0, 0

*
* Printer characteristics
* =======================
*
* This table specifies the printer command sequences.
* If the top bit of a code is set, then this indicates the position
* of a parameter passed to the printer. The code whose top bit is set
* in this table is added to the parameter passed before being sent to the
* printer. It is not used in all command sequences, only in those where 
* the printer requires  a variable value such as the length of a vertical 
* tab.
*
* 0            * Character width
1, D, A        * Linefeed WITH return
* 2            * Forward print
* 3            * Reverse print
* 5            * Absolute horizontal tab 
6, 1B, 45      * Draft bold on
7, 1B, 46      * Draft bold off
8, 1B, 45      * Near Letter Quality (NLQ) bold on 
9, 1B, 46      * NLQ bold off

B, 1B, 35      * Draft italic off
C, 1B, 34      * NLQ italic on
D, 1B, 35      * NLQ italic off
* E            * Draft light on
* F            * Draft light off
* 10           * NLQ light on

17, 1B, 54     * Draft subscript off
18, 1B, 53, 1  * NLQ subscript on
19, 1B, 54     * NLQ subscript off
1A, 1B, 2D, 1  * Draft underline on
1B, 1B, 2D, 0  * Draft underline off
1C, 1B, 2D, 1  * NLQ underline on
1D, 1B, 2D, 0  * NLQ underline off
1E, C          * Formfeed
1F, 12         * Horizontal initialisation
* 20           * Vertical initialisation
21, 1B, 40     * Termination: printer reset
0              * NULL termination byte

*
* Translation Table
* =================
*
* This table provides translation from single Atari input bytes into
* multiple printer codes, or to disable output of some characters.
*
* The entries must be arranged in ascending order of Atari input
* code. The table is NULL terminated.
* 

0         * NULL: print a space 
1         * CONTROL CODES: not printed
