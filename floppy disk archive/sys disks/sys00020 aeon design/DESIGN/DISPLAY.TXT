            ----------------------------------------- 

The game is played on a full screen display, with the hero moved 
by the keyboard, mouse or joystick. Two keys or mouse buttons use 
use whatever are carried in his left and right hands respectively, 
or the fire button uses what is in the current hand. 

Space, both mouse buttons together, or a long press of fire selects 
the possessions screen. Other actions are initiated by walking over 
objects shown on the screen, or bumping into them. 

The action display is shown below (characters represent 5*8 pixels):

STATUS BAR. The bottom of the screen shows a left hand and a right 
hand, each cupping the object held. Armour class is indicated by a 
helmet and a number, health by a partly-filled bar, wealth a bag of 
gold and a number, and dungeon level by a dragon head and a number. 
In the middle is the head of the chosen character (wizard, warrior 
or jester), with a short name and a number for the hero's current 
current experience level (e.g 9.85 would show that he was 9th level 
and well on the way to 10th). 


SPRITE NUMBERS. We plan to move the player and at least three other 
sprites, presumably enemies. Plus a few missiles in flight (though 
we will only let people fire one "arrow" at once). 


SPRITES are typically 64*32, though e.g a sword can extend further. 

Humanoid sprites are displayed "Double Dragon" fashion - facing 
diagonally, even if the creature moves orthoganally. (This takes 
only 40% as much ROM as holding all eight views, and avoids the 
rather boring view from directly behind.) Animals, on the other 
hand, will simply be shown from the side - facing left or right. 

The player sprite shows the current armour and weapons. If the 
player has a shield in his left hand, a sword in his right hand and 
owns a helmet, this is what will be seen. (The sprite data is built 
up, identikit fashion, as the object screen is left). 

The aim is for people and monsters to look solid and realistic. 

We will, however, ignore such realism when it seems right to do so. 
When the player fires a bow, the animated sequence of him stringing 
and firing an arrow will not show the shield he may be carrying (it 
would look odd). 


SPRITES IN RAM. To restrict the RAM needed for sprites, we only 
hold those parts of animation frames which change... When the 
player walks, for example, his head and upper body need not change 
- they just move sideways, with a one-or-two pixel dip at the low 
point of each stride - so, if his legs are replaced on a 5-frame 
cycle, this is the equivalent of only 2 whole frames. 

We will try to ensure that sprite data is ready before use. If a 
group of orcs are about to enter stage right, the program will try 
to pre-load appropriate sprite data. Likewise, if the player goes 
near a bean stalk, there should be a second or two to get the 
"climbing sequence" ready before it is needed. 

If creatures wade through water or vegetation, their legs need not 
be shown at all, which is probably the easiest special animation. 


BACKGROUND. Aeon is a room-based system and the background does not 
scroll. Instead, when the player leaves the current room (via back, 
side or front) there is a brief pause and the next one is displayed. 

The background has extensive spot animation, including all those 
flickering flames and swinging pendulum effects that you either 
love or hate, but that are good for attracting attention. 

Each backdrop is built up from a (relatively) limited selection of 
previously-drawn tiles, in the usual way when trying to decorate a 
lot of rooms with limited graphics data. But, in addition, we have 
quite cle long enough to 
recognise it. 


POSSESSIONS SCREEN. 

Space, both mouse buttons together, or a long press of fire toggles 
between the action display and the possessions screen. On this, 
keys, the mouse or joystick moves an eye pointer among the objects 
you own - in just the same way as the player moves on the action 
screen - and an enlarged view of the current object is seen at the 
top right. 

Press a key or mouse button to to switch the current object with 
whatever is held in the cor long enough to 
recognise it. 


POSSESSIONS SCREEN.

Press a key or mouse button to to switch the current object with 
whatever is held in the corresponding hand. When using the joystick, 
move the eye over a hand and press fire to make it the current hand, 
and later press fire to swap the current object with what it holds.

The status bar is the same as that on the action display. And the 
give eat and drop icons are possibly a head and shoulders picture 
of an anonymous person, an open mouth and an arrow pointing to the 
ground, respectively.
