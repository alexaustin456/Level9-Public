Dear Sir, 

         Some additional tips to supplement your hints for 
"Heroes of the Lance", which is one of those interesting games 
where you spend most of your time in pause mode: 


Only three of the seventeen spells are needed: Cure Light Wounds, 
Web (to paralise dangerous-looking opponents for disection at 
leasure) and Deflect Dragon Breath (for use against Khisanth). 

None of the treasures/potions/scrolls etc. that you find are needed. 

Fight everything but Hatchlings; run at these and dodge into a door. 
Raistlin jumps furthest. Save your position before circular doors. 

Goldmoon throws her staff at Khisanth (she can't throw it at other 
times); then get a fighter to run past the dying dragon to win. 


               I hope these are of interest
